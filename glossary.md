# Glossary workflow examples

This page is reserved for **glossary** workflow scenarios under `glossary/`.

At the moment, the `glossary/` directory in this repo is either empty or used for ad-hoc runs. As you add stable glossary workflows, list and describe them here.

The `tito glossary` workflow is used to extract and audit domain-specific term lists from KB documents. For details, rely on the main TITO documentation.

- Main repo: https://github.com/averrik/tito
- Quick start: [`docs/QUICKSTART.md`](https://github.com/averrik/tito/blob/main/docs/QUICKSTART.md)

## Directory layout

```text
glossary/
```

When populated, each scenario would typically follow the same pattern used elsewhere:

```text
glossary/<scenario>/
├── kb/
├── sessions/
└── task*.md
```

This page is intentionally conservative and only documents what is actually present in the repository.
