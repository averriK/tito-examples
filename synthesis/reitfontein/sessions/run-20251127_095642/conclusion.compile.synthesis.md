# Synthesis (conclusion)

### SLOT 1: Background Summary

The South Deep Gold Mine operates two tailings storage facility sites in South Africa: the Doornpoort New Facility at 27.4602°S, 27.6501°E and the South Deep Four Old Dams at 27.4172°S, 27.6734°E. SLR Consulting commissioned the Seismology Research Centre (SRC) to perform a site-specific Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Assessment (PSHA) to satisfy Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management requirements and enhance site characterization. The SRC PSHA yielded Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) values substantially higher than previously adopted design values, raising concerns about impacts on stability and deformation analyses. The elevated PGA values prompted SLR to recommend external review of the SRC work, particularly regarding the influence of mining-induced seismicity on the modeling outcomes.

### SLOT 2: Benchmarking Context Summary

Regional benchmarks reveal substantial divergence from the SRC PGA estimates. The Global Seismic Hazard Assessment Program (GSHAP) reports PGA values less than 0.01 g for the 475-year return period in the South Deep region, while the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) 2023 shows values of approximately 0.017-0.149 g, with stable cratonic regions typically at 0.02-0.04 g. SRK Consulting prepared an independent PSHA using ensemble ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs) calibrated for stable continental crust, producing PGA values of 0.055-0.088 g for the 475-year return period at comparable site conditions ($V_{s30} = 560$ m/s). The SRC PSHA yields 0.33 g for the same return period, representing a 3-6 fold increase over SRK estimates. For the approximately 10,000-year return period, SRC reports 1.3 g while SRK estimates range from 0.23-0.39 g, a difference that substantially exceeds typical epistemic uncertainty ranges in modern PSHA practice.

### SLOT 3: Principal Hypothesis for Elevated Hazard Summary

The fundamental hypothesis attributes the divergence between SRC PGA estimates and regional benchmarks to the epistemic characterization of the Reitfontein Fault rather than methodological deficiencies. The SRC PSHA is well-developed and follows state-of-the-art practices, with no major errors detected in the analytical framework. The elevated hazard originates specifically from treating the Reitfontein Fault as neotectonic and assigning parameters including slip rate (1 m/Myr), productivity coefficients, and maximum magnitude ($M_{\max} = 7.2$) that generate very high ground motion intensities for return periods at or below 10,000 years. Within the SRC assessment, the GEM model component that incorporates the Reitfontein Fault as a discrete source with $M_{\max} = 7.2$ produces 0.564 g at 475-year return period, compared to 0.157 g for the EZF Model and 0.103 g for the Smoothed Model, demonstrating that fault source parameterization dominates the hazard outcome.

### SLOT 4: Classification and Activity Status Summary

The Reitfontein Fault is best classified as paleoseismic rather than neotectonic based on the absence of geological or geomorphological evidence of movement within the last 35,000 years and only minor present-day seismic activity. Neotectonic faults are defined as structures accommodating displacement under the current crustal stress regime (roughly 40-11 million years ago in South Africa), yet no observable neotectonic features such as surface ruptures, displaced young sediments, or geomorphic markers have been documented for the Reitfontein Fault. The assigned slip rate of 1 m/Myr represents a conservative engineering assumption rather than empirically demonstrated activity. Singh et al. (2009) reported minor seismic activity and identified the fault as requiring reassessment to determine current activity status, emphasizing the uncertainty rather than confirming active classification. The lack of paleoseismic investigations constitutes a significant data gap, and the absence of observable features suggests that if the fault has been active in the relevant timeframe, the activity rate lies at or below detection limits of standard paleoseismic methods.

### SLOT 5: Rupture Length and Maximum Magnitude Summary

The 64 km rupture length assumption is justified as a conservative estimate based on the mapped extent of the Reitfontein Fault, though actual seismogenic length may be considerably shorter. Application of Wells and Coppersmith (1994) empirical scaling relationships for normal faulting yields $M_{\max} = 7.2$ for this length, with standard deviations of 0.25-0.35 magnitude units implying a reasonable range of approximately 6.85-7.55. However, several considerations limit this estimate: not all mapped fault length necessarily represents seismogenic length capable of rupturing in a single event, stable continental region earthquakes may exhibit different scaling relationships than the predominantly active tectonic earthquakes in the Wells and Coppersmith dataset, and the 64 km length likely includes segments with variable orientation relative to the current stress regime. The methodology establishes $M_{\min} = M_{\max} - 1.5$ for $M_{\max}$ between 6.5 and 7.4, yielding $M_{\min} = 5.7$ for the Reitfontein case. The use of full 64 km length represents a conservative upper bound appropriate for safety-critical infrastructure such as tailings storage facilities.

### SLOT 6: Regional Context and Comparative Analysis Summary

The assigned $M_{\max} = 7.2$ for the Reitfontein Fault substantially exceeds both historical seismicity and regional zone assignments in South Africa. The largest recorded South African earthquake (Ceres event, September 29, 1969) registered $M_w$ 6.2, representing a 1.0 magnitude unit difference equivalent to 32 times the seismic moment release. Current South African PSHA models assign $M_{\max}$ values of 5.3-6.3 for most regional zones. The GEM South Africa model assigns the ZEBED zone (which includes the study area) values of 5.28-5.93 across weighted branches, reflecting conservative assessment of seismogenic potential in the Kaapvaal Craton interior, while the CEDAR zone receives 5.73-6.54. The EZ-FRISK Africa model employs higher values: 7.23 for the Drakensberg zone and 7.0 for the Kaapvaal zone, though these zones span areas of 820,725 km$^2$ and 281,858 km$^2$ respectively. The Reitfontein value of 7.2 falls within the EZ-FRISK Drakensberg range but exceeds the more conservative GEM ZEBED estimates, highlighting epistemic uncertainty in stable continental region seismogenic potential assessments.

### SLOT 7: Slip Rate Uncertainty and Return Period Considerations Summary

No published slip rate exists for the Reitfontein Fault; the assigned 1 m/Myr value represents a conservative engineering assumption applied to bedrock faults lacking evidence of movement in the last 10 million years but included due to favorable orientation. Epistemic uncertainty in slip rate estimation constitutes a fundamental challenge in stable continental region PSHA, with available fault data often insufficient or carrying significant uncertainties. The Kango Fault, among South Africa's more active structures, exhibits slip rates of approximately 200 m/Myr--two hundred times higher than Reitfontein's assigned rate--yet produces similar maximum magnitudes (6.97-7.18), revealing a paradox in purely geometric scaling approaches that do not incorporate kinematic evidence. Length-based $M_{\max}$ estimation provides an upper bound on potential earthquake size but does not address occurrence probability within relevant timeframes. The slip rate range of 0.1-20 m/Myr mathematically permits seismic movements at return periods less than 10,000 years, but this possibility is strongly constrained by the absence of neotectonic evidence contradicting sustained slip rates greater than or equal to 1 m/Myr and the episodic behavior characteristic of stable continental region faults. For practical hazard assessment at return periods below 10,000 years, smaller magnitude events (M 5.5-6.5) will dominate rather than approach to $M_{\max}$.

### SLOT 8: Mining-Induced Seismicity Summary

Mining-induced seismicity is unlikely to trigger rupture of the entire 64 km Reitfontein Fault due to the 43 km distance from the South Deep Mine site and depth incompatibility between mining operations (up to 4 km) and seismogenic depths (5-16 km for natural events, typically 15-25 km in stable continental regions). The largest mining-related seismic event in South African history registered magnitude 5.3 (March 9, 2005), substantially below the energy required for a 64 km rupture. Mining-induced seismicity mechanisms involve stress redistribution from excavation, resulting in fracture initiation and movement along pre-existing planes of weakness. The PSHA study explicitly excludes events below M4.0 suspected of being mining-related to minimize induced seismicity influence. The Pretorius Fault, located 18 km from the mine site, contrasts with Reitfontein's 43 km distance, reinforcing that Reitfontein seismicity would be primarily tectonic rather than mining-induced, though mining may contribute to stress perturbations that could potentially reactivate fault segments. The depth differential and substantial lateral distance together indicate that while localized mining-induced seismicity occurs, it cannot plausibly activate the full length of the Reitfontein structure.
