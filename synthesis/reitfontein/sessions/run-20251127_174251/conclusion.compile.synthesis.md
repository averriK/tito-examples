# Synthesis (conclusion)

### SLOT 1: Background Summary

The South Deep Gold Mine operates two tailings storage facility sites in South Africa: the Doornpoort New Facility at 27.4602°S, 27.6501°E and the South Deep Four Old Dams at 27.4172°S, 27.6734°E. SLR Consulting commissioned the Seismology Research Centre to perform a site-specific Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Assessment to satisfy Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management requirements and improve upon 2008/2009 design parameters. The assessment produced Peak Ground Acceleration values substantially higher than previously adopted design values, prompting SLR to recommend a third-party review due to concerns about impacts on stability and deformation analyses.

### SLOT 2: Benchmarking Context Summary

Regional and global benchmarks reveal substantial divergence from SRC PGA estimates. The Global Seismic Hazard Assessment Program reports PGA values less than 0.01 g for the 475-year return period, while GEM 2023 shows South African cratonic regions typically experience 0.02-0.04 g. SRK Consulting prepared an independent PSHA using ensemble ground motion prediction equations calibrated for stable continental crust, producing 0.055-0.088 g for the 475-year return period at comparable site conditions ($V_{s30} = 560$ m/s). The SRC assessment yields 0.33 g for the same return period, representing a 3-6 fold increase. For the approximately 10,000-year return period, SRC reports 1.3 g while SRK estimates range from 0.23-0.39 g, differences that substantially exceed typical epistemic uncertainty bounds in modern PSHA practice.

### SLOT 3: Principal Hypothesis for Elevated Hazard Summary

The fundamental hypothesis attributes the divergence to the epistemic characterization of the Reitfontein Fault rather than methodological deficiencies. The SRC PSHA methodology is described as well-developed and following state-of-the-art practices, with no major errors detected. The elevated hazard originates from treating the Reitfontein Fault as neotectonic and assigning parameters including slip rate (1 m/Myr), productivity coefficients, and maximum magnitude ($M_{\max} = 7.2$) that generate very high ground motion intensities for return periods at or below 10,000 years. Within the SRC assessment, the GEM model component incorporating the Reitfontein Fault with $M_{\max} = 7.2$ produces 0.564 g at 475-year return period, compared to 0.157 g for the EZF Model and 0.103 g for the Smoothed Model, demonstrating that fault source parameterization dominates the hazard outcome.

### SLOT 4: Classification and Activity Status Summary

The Reitfontein Fault is characterized as paleoseismic rather than neotectonic based on the absence of geological or geomorphological evidence of movement within the last 35,000 years and only minor present-day seismic activity. Active faults are typically defined as structures with historical earthquakes or evidence of movement within this timeframe, criteria the Reitfontein Fault does not meet. The assigned slip rate of 1 m/Myr represents a conservative engineering assumption rather than empirically demonstrated activity. Singh et al. (2009) reported only minor seismic activity and identified the fault as requiring reassessment to determine current activity status, emphasizing uncertainty rather than confirming active classification. The lack of paleoseismic investigations constitutes a significant data gap, and the absence of observable neotectonic features suggests that if the fault has been active in the relevant timeframe, the activity rate lies at or below detection limits of standard paleoseismic methods.

### SLOT 5: Rupture Length and Maximum Magnitude Summary

The 64 km rupture length assumption is justified as a conservative estimate based on the mapped extent of the Reitfontein Fault, though actual seismogenic length may be considerably shorter. Application of Wells and Coppersmith (1994) empirical scaling relationships for normal faulting yields $M_{\max} = 7.2$ for this length, with standard deviations of 0.25-0.35 magnitude units implying a reasonable range of approximately 6.85-7.55. However, several considerations limit this estimate: not all mapped fault length necessarily represents seismogenic length capable of rupturing in a single event, stable continental region earthquakes may exhibit different scaling relationships than the predominantly active tectonic earthquakes in the Wells and Coppersmith dataset, and the 64 km length likely includes segments with variable orientation relative to the current stress regime. The use of full 64 km length represents a conservative upper bound appropriate for safety-critical infrastructure such as tailings storage facilities.

### SLOT 6: Regional Context and Comparative Analysis Summary

The assigned $M_{\max} = 7.2$ for the Reitfontein Fault substantially exceeds both historical seismicity and regional zone assignments in South Africa. The largest recorded South African earthquake (Ceres event, September 29, 1969) registered $M_w$ 6.2, representing a 1.0 magnitude unit difference equivalent to 32 times the seismic moment release. Current South African PSHA models assign $M_{\max}$ values of 5.3-6.3 for most regional zones. The GEM South Africa model assigns the ZEBED zone (which includes the study area) values of 5.28-5.93 across weighted branches, while the EZ-FRISK Africa model employs higher values: 7.23 for the Drakensberg zone and 7.0 for the Kaapvaal zone. The Reitfontein value of 7.2 falls within the EZ-FRISK Drakensberg range but exceeds the more conservative GEM ZEBED estimates, highlighting epistemic uncertainty in stable continental region seismogenic potential assessments.

### SLOT 7: Slip Rate Uncertainty and Return Period Considerations Summary

No published slip rate exists for the Reitfontein Fault; the assigned 1 m/Myr value represents a conservative engineering assumption applied to bedrock faults lacking evidence of movement in the last 10 million years but included due to favorable orientation. Epistemic uncertainty in slip rate estimation constitutes a fundamental challenge in stable continental region PSHA, with available fault data often insufficient or carrying significant uncertainties. The Kango Fault, among South Africa's more active structures, exhibits slip rates of approximately 200 m/Myr-two hundred times higher than Reitfontein's assigned rate-yet produces similar maximum magnitudes (6.97-7.18), revealing a paradox in purely geometric scaling approaches that do not incorporate kinematic evidence. Length-based $M_{\max}$ estimation provides an upper bound on potential earthquake size but does not address occurrence probability within relevant timeframes. While the slip rate range of 0.1-20 m/Myr mathematically permits seismic movements at return periods less than 10,000 years, this possibility is strongly constrained by the absence of neotectonic evidence contradicting sustained slip rates $\geq$ 1 m/Myr.

### SLOT 8: Mining-Induced Seismicity Summary

Mining-induced seismicity is unlikely to trigger rupture of the entire 64 km Reitfontein Fault due to the 43 km distance from the South Deep Mine site and depth incompatibility between mining operations (up to 4 km) and seismogenic depths (5-16 km for natural events, typically 15-25 km in stable continental regions). The largest mining-related seismic event in South African history registered magnitude 5.3 (March 9, 2005), substantially below the energy required for a 64 km rupture. Mining-induced seismicity mechanisms involve stress redistribution from excavation, resulting in fracture initiation and movement along pre-existing planes of weakness. The PSHA study explicitly excludes events below M4.0 suspected of being mining-related to minimize induced seismicity influence. The Reitfontein Fault location 43 km from the mine site contrasts with the Pretorius Fault at 18 km, indicating that Reitfontein seismicity would be primarily tectonic rather than mining-induced, though mining may contribute to stress perturbations that could potentially reactivate fault segments.
