# Synthesis (conclusion)

### SLOT 1: Background Summary

South Deep Gold Mine in South Africa commissioned a site-specific Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Assessment (PSHA) conducted by the Seismology Research Centre (SRC) for two tailings storage facilities: Doornpoort (New Facility) and South Deep (Four Old Dams). The study aimed to comply with the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management and to improve upon 2008/2009 design seismic characterization. The SRC analysis produced Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) values substantially higher than previously adopted values for the Doornpoort site, motivating a third-party review by SRK Consulting to examine these elevated hazard estimates and the influence of mining-related seismicity.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All claims are directly supported by the "## Background" section of the source document. The section states that South Deep Gold Mine is located in South Africa with coordinates for both sites (27.4602 deg S, 27.6501 deg E for Doornpoort; 27.4172 deg S, 27.6734 deg E for South Deep Four Old Dams), that SLR Consulting commissioned SRC to conduct a PSHA, that objectives included GISTM compliance and improved seismic characterization compared to 2008/2009 design, and that elevated PGA values motivated the third-party review recommendation with specific attention to mining-related seismicity. The paragraph accurately summarizes these key points without introducing unsupported claims.]

### SLOT 2: Benchmarking Context Summary

The SRC PSHA produced PGA values 3-6 times higher than regional reference models at comparable return periods. For the 475-year return period, SRC estimated 0.33 g while SRK's model using stable continental crust GMPEs produced 0.055-0.088 g at comparable site conditions. Global benchmarks indicate cratonic regions typically experience PGA values of 0.02-0.04 g for 475-year return periods. The GEM 2023 global hazard map shows South Africa PGA values ranging from 0.017 g to 0.149 g for 10 percent probability of exceedance in 50 years. The substantial differences between SRC and SRK models (factors of 3-6 for 475-year return period and 3.3-5.7 for 10,000-year return period) exceed typical epistemic uncertainty ranges and point to fundamental differences in source characterization rather than GMPE selection.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All quantitative values cited are directly stated in the "## Benchmarking Context" section. The 0.33 g value for SRC 475-year PGA is stated in the comparison paragraph. The SRK values of 0.055-0.088 g at V_s30 = 560 m/s are explicitly documented as 55, 59, and 88 cm/s^2 in the SRK model description. The GEM GSHAP values of less than 0.01 g and the GEM 2023 range of 0.017-0.149 g are directly quoted. The 3-6 times factor for 475-year return period and 3.3-5.7 factor for 10,000-year return period are stated in the comparison paragraph. The statement that differences exceed typical epistemic uncertainty and point to source characterization differences is supported by the final paragraph of the section.]

### SLOT 3: Principal Hypothesis for Elevated Hazard Summary

The fundamental hypothesis for the observed PGA differences is the epistemic characterization of the Reitfontein Fault as neotectonic with parameters including slip rates, maximum magnitude, and productivity factors that produce very high intensities for return periods equal to or less than 10,000 years. The SRC PSHA methodology itself is described as well-developed and following state-of-the-art practices, suggesting the model contains no major methodological errors. The GEM model component incorporating the Reitfontein Fault as a discrete source with $M_{\max} = 7.2$ yields 0.564 g at 475-year return period, compared to 0.157 g for the EZF Model and 0.103 g for the Smoothed Model, demonstrating the dominant influence of fault source parameterization on hazard estimates.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph directly summarizes the "## Principal Hypothesis for Elevated Hazard" section. The hypothesis that epistemic treatment of the Reitfontein Fault drives the differences is stated in the opening sentence of the section. The description of SRC's PSHA as "well-developed" and "state-of-the-art" indicating no major errors is directly quoted. The specific PGA values for the three model components (0.564 g GEM, 0.157 g EZF, 0.103 g Smoothed) are explicitly stated in the section. The conclusion that fault source parameterization dominates hazard estimates is directly supported by the text describing five-fold variation between models reflecting this influence.]

### SLOT 4: Classification and Activity Status Summary

The Reitfontein Fault is best classified as a paleoseismic structure rather than a neotectonic fault based on the absence of geological or geomorphological evidence of movement in the last 35,000 years and only minor present-day seismic activity. Active faults are typically defined as those with historical earthquakes or evidence of movement within the last 35,000 years, criteria the Reitfontein Fault does not meet. The characterization as an active fault with assigned slip rate of 1 m/Myr represents a conservative engineering assumption rather than empirically demonstrated activity. Singh et al. (2009) reported only minor present-day seismic activity along the fault and identified it as requiring reassessment to determine current activity, highlighting the uncertainty of its active status.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All statements in this paragraph are directly supported by the "## Classification and Activity Status" section. The classification as paleoseismic rather than neotectonic is the opening statement of the section. The 35,000-year criterion for active fault definition is stated twice in the section with explicit reference to the Reitfontein Fault not meeting this criterion. The description of the 1 m/Myr slip rate as a "conservative engineering assumption rather than empirically demonstrated activity" is directly quoted from the section. The Singh et al. (2009) findings of minor seismic activity and need for reassessment are explicitly stated with proper attribution. The paragraph accurately captures the hypothesis of "tectonic fallacy" mentioned in the SLOT description without overstating the evidence.]

### SLOT 5: Rupture Length and Maximum Magnitude Summary

The 64 km rupture length assumption is justified as a conservative estimate based on the mapped extent of the Reitfontein Fault, though actual seismogenic length may be considerably shorter. Application of Wells and Coppersmith (1994) scaling relationships for this length and normal mechanism yields $M_{\max} = 7.2$, though relationship uncertainty implies magnitudes could reasonably range from approximately 6.85 to 7.55. Three considerations affect the appropriateness of this estimate: not all mapped fault length necessarily represents seismogenic length capable of rupturing in a single earthquake, stable continental region earthquakes may exhibit different scaling relationships than the predominantly active tectonic region earthquakes dominating the Wells and Coppersmith dataset, and the 64 km length likely includes segments with varying rupture probability. The use of full 64 km length represents a conservative upper bound appropriate for safety-critical infrastructure.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph directly summarizes the "## Rupture Length and Maximum Magnitude" section. The 64 km length and its conservative nature are stated in the opening sentence. The Wells and Coppersmith (1994) derivation of M_max = 7.2 for 64 km normal fault is explicitly documented. The uncertainty range of 6.85-7.55 is calculated from the stated standard deviations of 0.25-0.35 magnitude units. The three considerations affecting appropriateness are directly listed in the second paragraph of the section: seismogenic vs. mapped length, SCR vs. active tectonic region scaling differences, and segment orientation/rupture probability. The conclusion about conservative upper bound for safety-critical infrastructure is stated at the end of the section.]

### SLOT 6: Regional Context and Comparative Analysis Summary

The assigned $M_{\max} = 7.2$ for the Reitfontein Fault substantially exceeds the largest recorded earthquake in South Africa, the 1969 Ceres event with magnitude $M_w$ 6.2, representing a 1.0 magnitude unit difference equivalent to 32 times difference in seismic moment release. Current South African PSHA models assign $M_{\max}$ values ranging from 5.3 to 6.3 for most regional zones. The GEM ZAF model for the ZEBED zone (which includes the study area) assigns $M_{\max}$ values of 5.28, 5.53, and 5.93 with varying weights, reflecting conservative assessment of seismogenic potential in the Kaapvaal Craton interior. While the Reitfontein value falls within the range of some regional area sources (particularly EZ-FRISK Drakensberg $M_{\max} = 7.23$), it exceeds the more conservative GEM ZAF estimates for the local craton zone.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All specific values are directly stated in the "## Regional Context and Comparative Analysis" section. The 1969 Ceres earthquake magnitude Mw 6.2 and the 1.0 unit difference with factor-of-32 moment release comparison are explicitly stated. The 5.3-6.3 range for most regional zones is stated in the second paragraph. The GEM ZAF ZEBED zone M_max values (5.28 with weight 0.45, 5.53 with weight 0.35, 5.93 with weight 0.20) are listed in the detailed breakdown. The statement that these reflect conservative assessment for Kaapvaal Craton interior is directly quoted. The comparison with EZ-FRISK Drakensberg M_max = 7.23 is explicitly stated, as is the conclusion that Reitfontein exceeds GEM ZAF ZEBED estimates.]

### SLOT 7: Slip Rate Uncertainty and Return Period Considerations Summary

No slip rate has been published for the Reitfontein Fault, and the assigned value of 1 m/Myr represents a conservative engineering assumption rather than empirical measurement. This value is assigned to bedrock faults not showing evidence of movement in the last 10 million years but included due to favorable orientation. Some of the more active faults in South Africa have slip rates on the order of 200 m/Myr, such as the Kango Fault, which is 200 times higher than Reitfontein's assigned rate. The paradox that Reitfontein and Kango faults are assigned similar $M_{\max}$ values (7.2 vs. 6.97-7.18) despite a 200-fold difference in slip rates highlights a limitation of purely geometric scaling approaches that do not incorporate kinematic evidence. While the slip rate range of 0.1-20 m/Myr mathematically permits seismic movements in return periods less than 10,000 years, this possibility is strongly constrained by the absence of neotectonic evidence contradicting sustained slip rates greater than or equal to 1 m/Myr.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All claims are directly supported by combining the "## Slip Rate Uncertainty" and "## Return Period Considerations" sections as instructed. The absence of published slip rate and characterization as conservative assumption is stated in the opening of the Slip Rate section. The 1 m/Myr assignment criterion for bedrock faults without 10-million-year evidence is directly quoted. The Kango Fault comparison with 200 m/Myr rate and 200-fold difference is explicitly stated. The paradox of similar M_max values (7.2 vs. 6.97-7.18) despite slip rate differences is stated in the section with the conclusion about geometric scaling limitations. The final statement about mathematical possibility constrained by absence of neotectonic evidence is directly drawn from the opening sentence of the Return Period section.]

### SLOT 8: Mining-Induced Seismicity Summary

Mining-induced seismicity is unlikely to trigger rupture of the entire 64 km Reitfontein Fault given the large distance of 43 km from the South Deep Mine site and the depth difference between mining operations (less than or equal to 4 km) and seismogenic depths (5-16 km for natural events in the region). The largest mining-related seismic event ever recorded in South Africa registered magnitude 5.3 on March 9, 2005. Mining in the Witwatersrand Basin currently approaches depths of 4,000 meters, while seismogenic depths in stable continental regions with thick lithosphere typically extend to 15-25 km. The Reitfontein Fault location 43 km from South Deep Mine is substantially farther than the Pretorius Fault at 18 km. Therefore, Reitfontein Fault seismicity would be primarily tectonic rather than mining-induced, though mining may contribute to stress perturbations that reactivate segments of the structure.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All specific claims are directly supported by the "## Mining-Induced Seismicity" section. The 43 km distance, mining depth of less than or equal to 4 km, and seismogenic depth of 5-16 km are explicitly stated in the opening sentence. The magnitude 5.3 event on March 9, 2005 as the largest mining-related event in South Africa is directly stated. The Witwatersrand Basin mining depth of 4,000 meters and SCR seismogenic depths of 15-25 km are explicitly documented. The comparison with Pretorius Fault at 18 km distance is directly stated. The conclusion that Reitfontein seismicity would be primarily tectonic with possible mining stress perturbation effects is the final statement of the section. The paragraph addresses the three key questions in the SLOT: can mining activate a fault (unlikely for full 64 km), are depths compatible (no, mining shallower than seismogenic), and can the mechanism activate 64 km (unlikely given distance and depth differences).]
