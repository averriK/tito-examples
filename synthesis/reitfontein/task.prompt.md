## SLOTS

### SLOT 1: Background Summary
Summarise the "## Background" section. Who is the client, where is the project located, and what is the motivation for this study? The elevated PGA values motivated this study. 50-80 Words

### SLOT 2: Benchmarking Context Summary
Summarise the section "## Benchmarking Context". The important thing here is to highlight the PGA values obtained by different authors in the past for the same region, and even for the same site. This section has three main paragraphs: the values obtained by SRC (the author we are reviewing), the values obtained by the reviewer (SRK, us), and the values reported by GEM/GSHAP. 50-80 Words

### SLOT 3: Principal Hypothesis for Elevated Hazard Summary
Summarise the section "# Principal Hypothesis for Elevated Hazard". This section is very important as it first highlights the differences between the PSHA study by SRC and other authors. It makes clear that the work carried out by SRC is excellent and no major methodological errors are detected. Therefore, the fundamental hypothesis proposed is that the problem (the 3-6x difference in PGA) originates from the characterisation of the Reitfontein Fault. 50-80 Words

### SLOT 4: Classification and Activity Status Summary
Summarise the section "## Classification and Activity Status". This section emphasises the hypothesis of tectonic fallacy against the documented evidence. 50-80 Words

### SLOT 5: Rupture Length and Maximum Magnitude Summary
Summarise the section "## Rupture Length and Maximum Magnitude", highlighting how Mmax was calculated or defined in the PSHA, and the limitations or contradictions of this value. 50-80 Words

### SLOT 6: Regional Context and Comparative Analysis Summary
Summarise the section "## Regional Context and Comparative Analysis" highlighting how the value of Mmax=7.2 'conflicts' with the values of stable cratons and the allocations made by GEM to the regions where the Reitfontein fault is located. 50-80 Words

### SLOT 7: Slip Rate Uncertainty and Return Period Considerations Summary
Summarise the section "## Slip Rate Uncertainty" combined with the section "## Return Period Considerations". 70-100 Words

### SLOT 8: Mining-Induced Seismicity Summary
Summarise the section: "## Mining-Induced Seismicity". Can seismic activity induced by mining activate a fault? Are the depths of the Reitfontein fault compatible with those of the induced seismicity? Can this mechanism activate a 64 km fault? This is the most important. 50-80 Words
