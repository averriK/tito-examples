# Louvicourt translation – compiled research report (English → Spanish)

Context:
- The KB directory contains `kb/louvicourt.compile.research.md`, a **formatted** English report generated by the `compile-research` workflow for the Louvicourt PSHA study.
- This document already has a clean Markdown structure: headings (`##`, `###`), numbered sections, paragraphs, and tables expressed in text.

Goal:
- Translate `kb/louvicourt.compile.research.md` from English to Spanish, **preserving the document structure**:
  - Same headings (levels and order),
  - Same section numbering (1.0, 1.1, 2.0, etc.),
  - Same paragraph boundaries,
  - Same lists and tables (only translating the textual content).

## Languages and domain

- Source language: `en-CA` (English, Canada; treat as generic technical English).
- Target language: `es-ES` (Spanish; neutral technical register appropriate for engineering reports).
- Domain: site-specific probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) for a tailings storage facility in a stable continental region.

## Documents

- KB directory for this example: `kb/`.
- Document to translate: `kb/louvicourt.compile.research.md`.
- Translate the **entire document**, including:
  - Executive summary,
  - Main sections and subsections,
  - Table captions and figure captions,
  - Headings, lists, and explanatory text.

## Structural constraints

- Treat the **Markdown structure of `louvicourt.compile.research.md` as authoritative**:
  - Do NOT introduce synthetic headings like `SEG-001` or similar.
  - Do NOT add wrapper blocks such as `TEXTO ORIGEN` / `TRADUCCION`.
  - For each heading (`#`, `##`, `###`), produce the corresponding heading in Spanish in the **same position and level**.
  - For each paragraph under a heading, produce exactly one translated paragraph, in the same order.
  - For lists and tables, preserve the Markdown structure (bullets, numbering, table rows), translating only the textual content.

## Audit and citations

- For each translated paragraph, append a single audit footnote following `rules/audit.md`:
  - `^[Verdict: TRUE|FALSE|UNCERTAIN, Confidence: HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW, Rationale: ...]`
  - Rationale MUST be concise (1–2 sentences), focused on:
    - Fidelity of the translation (does it preserve meaning?),
    - Correctness of key technical terms.
  - Do NOT write essay-length rationales.

- Evidence and citations:
  - Keep any existing `[@Key]` citations exactly as they appear in the source.
  - If you need to justify a terminology choice with external sources, use TOKEN citations `[WEB:/DOI:/ARXIV:/ZOTERO:]` sparingly (at most 1–2 per paragraph, and only for genuinely ambiguous terms).
  - Prefer terminology already used consistently in the KB document over speculative translations.

## Terminology constraints

- Do NOT invent new Spanish acronyms unless they already appear in the KB or in a compiled glossary (if present in the KB directory).
- For core concepts like PSHA, TSF, UHS, AEP, etc.:
  - You may translate the expanded form on first use (e.g., "Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis" → "análisis probabilístico de peligrosidad sísmica"),
  - But keep the original English acronym (PSHA, TSF, UHS, AEP) unless a well-established Spanish acronym is clearly supported by evidence.

## Output expectations

- The final output of the `translate` workflow for this task MUST be a single Markdown document:
  - Same sectioning and layout as `louvicourt.compile.research.md`,
  - All running text in Spanish,
  - One audit footnote per paragraph,
  - No duplicated source text.
- Do not generate `biblatex.bib` in this workflow; this is a session-only translation run.
