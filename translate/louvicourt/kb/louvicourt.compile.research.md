# Seismic Hazard Assessment for Louvicourt Tailings Storage Facility

## SLOT 1: Tectonic regimes within 1000 km

The Louvicourt tailings storage facility site in southwestern Quebec is situated within the Canadian Shield physiographic province, which is part of the North American Craton [@WSP2024]. The Canadian Shield formed from the collision of Archean-age microcontinents during the Paleoproterozoic (2.5 to 1.6 Ga), with the microcontinents combining to form the ancient continent of Laurentia [@WSP2024]. This region is characterized as a stable continental region (SCR), specifically within the Central and Eastern North America (CENA) tectonic domain [@WSP2024]. The site is located within the Abitibi Sub-province of the Superior Province, near the boundary with the Pontiac Sub-province, marked by the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone [@WSP2024]. The tectonic regime controlling seismicity within the 1000 km radius is that of a cratonic interior, where seismicity is infrequent, diffuse, and generally not associated with mapped geological structures [@WSP2024] [@USGS2024]. The Canadian Shield represents one of the oldest known cratons containing rocks dating back several billion years [@WSP2024]. This stable continental regime influences the PSHA by producing relatively low seismicity rates, large epicentral distances for controlling earthquakes, and ground motion attenuation characteristics distinct from those in active tectonic regions [@WSP2024]. The seismic source model implemented for this PSHA is the sixth-generation seismic hazard model of Canada (CanadaSHM6), which was specifically developed for southeastern Canada by the Geological Survey of Canada [@WSP2024]. The CanadaSHM6 incorporates areal seismic sources that represent the diffuse seismicity characteristic of stable continental regions rather than discrete fault sources [@WSP2024].

The Louvicourt Tailings Storage Facility site is located in southwestern Quebec within the Canadian Shield physiographic province, which forms part of the North American Craton. The Canadian Shield represents one of the oldest known cratons containing rocks dating back several billion years and is characterized by generally stable continental crust that has not experienced major tectonism, magmatism, basement metamorphism, or anorogenic intrusion since the early Cretaceous. The regional tectonic setting within a 1000 km radius around the project site is dominated by the Stable Continental Region classification, where seismicity occurs within ancient cratonic rocks that have persisted through multiple cycles of continental rifting, basin formation, contraction, folding, faulting, and uplift. The site lies specifically within the Abitibi Sub-province of the Superior Province, positioned near the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone, which marks the boundary between the Abitibi and Pontiac sub-provinces. This tectonic regime influences seismicity relevant to the probabilistic seismic hazard assessment through its characteristic low rates of crustal deformation, absence of active plate boundary conditions, and diffuse distribution of earthquake epicenters that are generally not associated with mapped surface faults. Historical seismicity analysis indicates the site is within a region of relatively low earthquake occurrence, with only five earthquakes of moment magnitude greater than 4.5 recorded within approximately 300 km of the Louvicourt site, the largest being the 1935 Timiskaming earthquake at magnitude 6.1 located approximately 190 km southwest of the mine. The diffuse seismicity pattern and lack of concentrated earthquake activity along major fault zones such as the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone indicate that these structures are presently seismically and geologically inactive despite their prominent geological expression. The tectonic regime therefore contributes to the hazard through distributed background seismicity within stable continental crust rather than through identifiable active fault sources, which fundamentally shapes the seismic source model used in the probabilistic assessment. [@WSP2024]

The Louvicourt TSF site is located within a Stable Continental Region (SCR) tectonic regime, specifically in the Canadian Shield, which forms part of the North American Craton. Cratons are regions containing very old rocks (more than 1 Ga) and are usually tectonically stable parts of the continental lithosphere that have persisted through several cycles of continental rifting and basin formation [@WSP2024]. The site is situated in southwestern Quebec within the Canadian Shield physiographic province, with local bedrock composed of Archean and Proterozoic basement rocks exceeding 2.7 billion years in age [@WSP2024]. The region is part of the ancient continent of Laurentia, formed during the Paleoproterozoic (2.5 to 1.6 Ga), and is located specifically within the Superior Province, Abitibi Sub-province [@WSP2024]. This tectonic setting is explicitly classified as SCR for central and eastern North America (CENA), and the 17 NGA-East ground motion models (GMMs) used in the probabilistic seismic hazard assessment (PSHA) reflect the most up-to-date published and vetted GMMs developed for stable continental regions [@WSP2024]. The SCR regime influences seismicity relevant to the PSHA by establishing the site as an intraplate setting with no active plate boundaries within 1000 km, resulting in relatively infrequent but potentially moderate to large magnitude earthquakes occurring within diffuse areal source zones rather than on discrete active faults [@WSP2024].

The Louvicourt TSF site is located within the Canadian Shield physiographic province of southwestern Quebec, which forms part of the North American Craton [@WSP2024]. The Canadian Shield represents one of the oldest known cratons globally, containing rocks dating back several billion years and formed from the collision of Archean-age microcontinents during the Paleoproterozoic period spanning 2.5 to 1.6 billion years ago [@WSP2024]. This tectonic setting is characterized as a Stable Continental Region (SCR), also referred to as Central and Eastern North America (CENA) in ground motion modeling contexts [@WSP2024]. Within approximately 1000 km of the site, the dominant seismotectonic regime is that of intraplate seismicity occurring within ancient cratonic crust, where earthquakes are generated by stress accumulation within the stable continental lithosphere rather than along active plate boundaries [@WSP2024]. The region exhibits relatively low historical earthquake activity compared to active tectonic margins, with only five earthquakes of moment magnitude $M_w$ greater than 4.5 recorded within 300 km of the site since historical records began [@WSP2024]. The largest historical event in the broader region was the 1935 Timiskaming earthquake with magnitude $M_w$ 6.1, located approximately 190 km southwest of the Louvicourt site [@WSP2024]. The seismic hazard within the 1000 km radius is dominated by several seismic source zones defined in the sixth-generation Canadian seismic hazard model (CanadaSHM6), with the Charlevoix seismic zone representing the largest contributor to hazard across multiple return periods, followed by the Gatineau source zone [@WSP2024]. These source zones represent areas of concentrated historical seismicity within the broader stable continental regime, where localized stress concentrations or crustal weaknesses facilitate earthquake generation despite the overall tectonic stability of the craton [@WSP2024]. The CanadaSHM6 model divides southeastern Canada into multiple seismic source zones based on three alternative sub-models: the Historical (H2) model based on earthquake locations and magnitudes, the Regional (R2) model based on geological criteria, and the Hybrid (HY) model combining both approaches [@WSP2024].

## SLOT 2: Source type classification (SCC)

The seismic sources in the site-specific source model are classified as stable continental crust (SCC) or stable continental region (SCR) type [@WSP2024]. The PSHA report states that the 17 NGA-East ground motion models (GMMs) were selected specifically because they were developed for stable continental regions in central and eastern North America, indicating that all seismic sources are treated as SCR type [@WSP2024]. The report explicitly notes that the NGA-East median ground motions are suitable for the assessment because the Louvicourt TSF site is surrounded by a stable continental region tectonic setting [@WSP2024]. The CanadaSHM6 seismic source model adopted for this study consists of areal sources representing the diffuse seismicity characteristic of stable continental regions rather than active fault sources [@WSP2024]. The report confirms that major fault zones in the region, including the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone, are not included as discrete seismic sources because they are presently seismically and geologically inactive, lacking earthquake epicenter alignments and geomorphic evidence for past surface fault rupture [@WSP2024]. Therefore, all seismic sources included in the site-specific source model are of stable continental crust (SCC) type, with no non-SCC sources identified or included in the model [@WSP2024].

All seismic sources included in the site-specific seismic source model for the Louvicourt assessment are classified as Stable Continental Crust type based on the tectonic characterization of the region. The probabilistic seismic hazard analysis implements the sixth-generation seismic hazard model of Canada developed by Natural Resources Canada for the 2020 National Building Code of Canada without modification to the source characterization. This model consists of three separate sub-models for southeastern Canada designated as Historical, Regional, and Hybrid, with assigned weights of 0.4, 0.2, and 0.4 respectively. Each sub-model defines areal seismic source zones that represent regions of distributed seismicity within the stable continental crust rather than discrete fault sources. The seismic sources include zones such as Charlevoix, Gatineau, and other areas within the southeastern Canada model domain, all of which are characterized by intraplate seismicity occurring within ancient cratonic rocks of the Canadian Shield and adjacent stable platform regions. The ground motion models selected for the assessment explicitly recognize this source classification, as the 17 NGA-East ground motion models were developed specifically for central and eastern North America, which is tectonically characterized as a Stable Continental Region. The absence of any active tectonic features, plate boundaries, or identified active neotectonic faults within the source model confirms the uniform Stable Continental Crust classification for all contributing sources. The decision to use NGA-East models rather than ground motion prediction equations developed for active crustal regions reflects the fundamental tectonic distinction between stable continental interiors and active plate margin environments. No non-Stable Continental Crust sources are included in the site-specific seismic source model, and the entire probabilistic analysis framework from source characterization through ground motion prediction is predicated on the stable continental tectonic regime that characterizes southeastern Canada. [@WSP2024]

All seismic sources included in the site-specific seismic source model for the Louvicourt TSF are of Stable Continental Crust (SCR) type. The entire seismic source model uses the CanadaSHM6 framework for southeastern Canada, which consists of three sub-models: Historical (H2), Regional (R2), and Hybrid (HY), with logic tree weights of 0.4, 0.2, and 0.4 respectively [@WSP2024]. All sub-models consist exclusively of areal seismic sources, defined as sources not known or associated with mapped faults, rather than discrete fault sources [@WSP2024]. The major structural features in the region, including the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone located within 10 km of the site, are at present seismically and geologically inactive, as evidenced by the nature of fault zone rocks, their present-day tectonic setting within the Canadian Shield, lack of earthquake epicenter alignments, and no geomorphic evidence for past surface fault rupture [@WSP2024]. Accordingly, these faults are not included as discrete seismic sources in the site-specific seismic source model [@WSP2024]. The three primary controlling source zones identified in the hazard deaggregation are Charlevoix (CHV) in the H2 sub-model as the largest contributor, Charlevoix (CHVHY) in the HY sub-model as the second largest contributor, and Gatineau (GAT) as the third largest contributor [@WSP2024]. All ground motion models applied in the PSHA are SCR-specific, comprising 17 NGA-East GMMs developed for CENA/SCR conditions [@WSP2024]. No active crustal (AC) sources characteristic of plate boundary regions are identified or modeled within the assessment area, and no subduction zone sources exist within the region [@WSP2024].

## SLOT 3: Controlling events for frequent hazard levels

For annual exceedance probabilities (AEP) between 1/475 and 1/1000 years, the hazard deaggregation results identify the controlling earthquake scenarios [@WSP2024]. The PSHA report provides Table 6, which summarizes the average distance, magnitude, and epsilon from magnitude-distance disaggregation of hazard from all sources [@WSP2024]. For the 1/2,475 AEP (close to the 1/475 to 1/1000 range), the modal magnitude values range from $M_w$ 6.8 to $M_w$ 7.4 across different spectral periods [@WSP2024]. The modal epicentral distances for these frequent hazard levels range from approximately 90 km to 180 km [@WSP2024]. At peak ground acceleration (PGA), the mean magnitude is approximately $M_w$ 7.1 with a mean distance of about 150 km [@WSP2024]. At a spectral period of 0.2 seconds, similar magnitudes and distances control the hazard [@WSP2024]. At longer periods (0.5 s and 1.0 s), the controlling magnitudes shift slightly toward $M_w$ 7.2 to $M_w$ 7.4, with distances remaining in the 140 km to 170 km range [@WSP2024]. The disaggregation figures show that the largest contribution to seismic hazard at these frequent return periods comes from moderate- to large-magnitude earthquakes ($M_w$ 6.8 to $M_w$ 7.5) at source-to-site distances of about 100 to 200 km [@WSP2024]. There are also smaller contributions from moderate-magnitude earthquakes (typically $M_w$ less than 6.0) within about 40 km of the site, particularly at short spectral periods [@WSP2024].

For the frequent hazard levels with annual exceedance probabilities between 1/475 and 1/2,475 years at the Louvicourt site, the probabilistic seismic hazard analysis results indicate that the controlling earthquake scenarios are characterized by moderate to large magnitudes in the range of moment magnitude 6.6 to 7.4 at epicentral distances between approximately 140 km and 280 km from the site. The magnitude-distance-epsilon disaggregation analysis for the 1/2,475 annual exceedance probability hazard level shows that for peak ground acceleration, the mean magnitude bin is 6.6 to 6.8 with mean distance of 140 to 160 km, while the modal values are magnitude 7.2 to 7.4 at distance 160 to 180 km. For spectral acceleration at 0.2 second period, the controlling magnitudes shift slightly higher with mean and median bins of 6.8 to 7.0 and mode of 7.0 to 7.2, all occurring at distances centered around 160 to 180 km. At longer spectral periods representative of structural response, specifically 0.5 second and 1.0 second periods, the controlling scenarios show mean magnitudes of 7.0 to 7.2 with distances increasing to 220 to 240 km mean for 0.5 second and 260 to 280 km mean for 1.0 second period, though the modal distance remains 160 to 180 km across these periods. The epsilon values associated with these controlling scenarios range from 0.5 to 1.5, indicating that the hazard at this probability level is driven by ground motions that are between 0.5 and 1.5 standard deviations above the median ground motion prediction for the given magnitude-distance combinations. The disaggregation results reveal that the dominant seismic source zones contributing to the frequent hazard levels are the Charlevoix source zone in the Historical sub-model and its equivalent in the Hybrid sub-model, along with significant contributions from the Gatineau source zone. These controlling event characteristics reflect the regional seismicity pattern of southeastern Canada where moderate to large intraplate earthquakes at intermediate distances dominate the seismic hazard across all spectral periods evaluated. [@WSP2024]

For frequent hazard levels corresponding to annual exceedance probabilities (AEP) between 1/475 and 1/1000 years, the controlling seismic scenarios at the Louvicourt site are characterized by moderate-magnitude earthquakes at intermediate distances [@WSP2024]. The hazard disaggregation results for the 1/2475 AEP (approximately 475-year return period) indicate that earthquakes with moment magnitudes ranging from $M_w$ 6.6 to $M_w$ 7.4 at source-to-site distances between 140 km and 180 km dominate the hazard contribution across multiple spectral periods [@WSP2024]. Specifically, at peak ground acceleration (PGA), the mean distance bin is 140-160 km, the median is 140-160 km, and the mode is 160-180 km, with corresponding mean magnitude bin of $M_w$ 6.6-6.8, median of $M_w$ 6.8-7.0, and mode of $M_w$ 7.2-7.4 [@WSP2024]. At the 0.2-second spectral period relevant to short-period structures, the disaggregation shows a mean and median distance of 160-180 km with mode at 160-180 km, and magnitude bins consistently in the $M_w$ 6.8 to $M_w$ 7.2 range [@WSP2024]. For longer spectral periods such as 0.5 seconds and 1.0 second, the controlling distances shift slightly farther, with mean distances in the 220-240 km and 260-280 km ranges respectively, while magnitudes remain in the $M_w$ 7.0 to $M_w$ 7.4 range [@WSP2024]. The epsilon values (number of standard deviations above the median ground motion) for the 1/2475 AEP range from 0.5 to 1.5, indicating that ground motions at this hazard level are generally within one to two standard deviations above the median predictions [@WSP2024]. These disaggregation results demonstrate relatively consistent controlling scenarios across different spectral periods at the frequent hazard level, with moderate-to-large magnitude earthquakes originating primarily from the Charlevoix and Gatineau seismic source zones located at distances of approximately 150-250 km from the Louvicourt site [@WSP2024].

## SLOT 4: Controlling events for rare hazard levels

For rare annual exceedance probabilities between 1/5,000 and 1/10,000 years, the controlling earthquake scenarios are characterized by similar magnitude ranges but with some differences in the distance distribution compared to more frequent events [@WSP2024]. Table 6 provides disaggregation results for both the 1/5,000 and 1/10,000 AEPs [@WSP2024]. For the 1/5,000 AEP, modal magnitude values range from $M_w$ 7.0 to $M_w$ 7.4 across different spectral periods, with modal distances in the range of 90 km to 170 km [@WSP2024]. For the 1/10,000 AEP, which represents the rarest hazard level analyzed, modal magnitudes range from $M_w$ 7.2 to $M_w$ 7.5, with modal distances ranging from approximately 90 km to 170 km [@WSP2024]. Figure 17 presents the magnitude-distance-epsilon disaggregation for the 1/10,000 AEP and shows that the largest contribution comes from earthquakes with magnitudes of about $M_w$ 6.8 to $M_w$ 7.5 and source-to-site distances of about 100 to 200 km, for both shorter spectral periods (e.g., 0.2 s) and longer spectral periods (e.g., 1.0 s) [@WSP2024]. The mean, median, and mode values for magnitude and distance generally agree at both shorter and longer spectral periods [@WSP2024]. At these rare return periods, there are smaller contributions from moderate- to large-magnitude earthquakes ($M_w$ 6.8 to $M_w$ 7.4) at greater source-to-site distances of about 360 km and greater [@WSP2024]. The controlling scenarios for rare hazard levels are characterized by slightly higher magnitudes and similar or slightly shorter distances compared to the more frequent hazard levels [@WSP2024].

For the rare hazard levels with annual exceedance probabilities between 1/5,000 and 1/10,000 years, the controlling earthquake scenarios shift toward consistently higher magnitudes while maintaining similar or slightly closer epicentral distances compared to the frequent hazard levels. The disaggregation results for the 1/5,000 annual exceedance probability show that across all spectral periods from peak ground acceleration through 1.0 second, the controlling magnitudes are in the range of moment magnitude 6.8 to 7.4, with most scenarios concentrated in the 7.0 to 7.4 range. Specifically, for peak ground acceleration at 1/5,000 annual exceedance probability, the mean magnitude is 6.8 to 7.0 with modal magnitude of 7.2 to 7.4, occurring at mean and modal distances of 140 to 160 km. For the 1/10,000 annual exceedance probability hazard level, the controlling scenarios show further progression toward larger magnitudes with values predominantly in the 6.8 to 7.4 range and modal values consistently at 7.2 to 7.4 across all spectral periods evaluated. At this rarest hazard level, distances show slight reduction with mean values ranging from 120 to 240 km depending on spectral period, with peak ground acceleration controlled by events at 120 to 140 km mean distance, spectral acceleration at 0.2 second controlled at 140 to 160 km, and longer periods at 180 to 240 km mean distance. The modal distance for the 1/10,000 annual exceedance probability remains 160 to 180 km across most spectral periods, indicating that this distance band represents a persistent contributor to the hazard regardless of probability level. The epsilon values for these rare hazard levels are predominantly 1.5, indicating that the rare ground motion levels are achieved through earthquakes producing shaking approximately 1.5 standard deviations above the median predicted ground motion. These controlling event characteristics demonstrate that at rare return periods, the hazard is dominated by the potential for larger magnitude earthquakes in the 7.0 to 7.4 range occurring at distances between approximately 120 km and 240 km, with the same source zones identified for frequent hazards continuing to control the rare hazard contributions. [@WSP2024]

For rare annual exceedance probabilities between 1/5,000 and 1/10,000 years, the PSHA disaggregation results reveal consistent controlling earthquake scenarios across spectral periods. At 1/5,000 AEP, the modal magnitude values are $M_w$ 7.2-7.4 across all spectral periods (PGA, 0.2 s, 0.5 s, 1.0 s), with rupture distances ranging from 140-220 km and modal values concentrated at 140-160 km for shorter periods and 160-180 km for longer periods [@WSP2024]. The epsilon values for these scenarios are consistently 1.5 across all periods [@WSP2024]. For the 1/10,000 AEP hazard level, the controlling magnitudes remain in the $M_w$ 7.2-7.4 modal range for all spectral periods, with rupture distances of 120-240 km and modal values of 160-180 km [@WSP2024]. The epsilon values are again uniformly 1.5 across all periods at this hazard level [@WSP2024]. The dominant contributors to seismic hazard at these rare exceedance probabilities are moderate to large magnitude earthquakes (approximately $M_w$ 6.8 to $M_w$ 7.4) at distances of about 100 km to 200 km from the Louvicourt TSF site [@WSP2024]. The three primary seismic source zones controlling this rare hazard are Charlevoix (CHV) in the H2 sub-model, Charlevoix (CHVHY) in the HY sub-model, and Gatineau (GAT), which are the same zones dominating the frequent hazard levels [@WSP2024]. The remarkable consistency of modal distance (160-180 km) across both hazard levels and all spectral periods indicates that the controlling earthquakes originate from similar epicentral locations regardless of the return period, with the primary variation occurring in the magnitude distribution rather than spatial location [@WSP2024].

For rare hazard levels corresponding to annual exceedance probabilities between 1/5000 and 1/10000 years, the controlling seismic scenarios shift toward slightly larger magnitudes and somewhat shorter distances compared to the frequent hazard levels [@WSP2024]. At the 1/5000 AEP, disaggregation results show that earthquakes with moment magnitudes in the $M_w$ 6.8 to $M_w$ 7.4 range and source-to-site distances between 140 km and 220 km dominate the hazard [@WSP2024]. Specifically, for PGA at 1/5000 AEP, the mean and median distance bins are both 140-160 km with mode at 140-160 km, while mean magnitude is $M_w$ 6.8-7.0, median is $M_w$ 7.0-7.2, and mode is $M_w$ 7.2-7.4 [@WSP2024]. The epsilon values at 1/5000 AEP are predominantly 1.0 to 1.5, indicating ground motions approximately one to two standard deviations above the median [@WSP2024]. At the 1/10000 AEP, the controlling magnitudes increase further, with modal values consistently at $M_w$ 7.2-7.4 across all spectral periods analyzed [@WSP2024]. For PGA at 1/10000 AEP, the mean distance is 120-140 km, median is 120-140 km, and mode is 160-180 km, with mean magnitude $M_w$ 6.8-7.0, median $M_w$ 7.0-7.2, and mode $M_w$ 7.2-7.4 [@WSP2024]. At 0.2-second spectral period for 1/10000 AEP, the distances are 140-160 km for mean and median, 160-180 km for mode, with magnitudes of $M_w$ 7.0-7.2 for mean, $M_w$ 7.0-7.2 for median, and $M_w$ 7.2-7.4 for mode [@WSP2024]. Epsilon values at the 1/10000 AEP range from 1.1 to 1.3, indicating that the rare hazard levels require ground motions approximately 1.5 standard deviations above the median [@WSP2024]. These results indicate that as the return period increases from 5000 to 10000 years, the hazard becomes increasingly controlled by larger magnitude events ($M_w$ 7.0-7.4) at distances of approximately 140-200 km, with the Charlevoix seismic source zone remaining the dominant contributor across these rare hazard levels [@WSP2024].

## SLOT 5: Active neotectonic faults within 100 km

Within 100 km of the Louvicourt site, there are no identified active neotectonic faults included in the seismic source model [@WSP2024]. The PSHA report explicitly states that the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone, a major structural complex located approximately 10 km from the site, is not included as a discrete seismic source [@WSP2024]. The report provides several lines of evidence for this exclusion: the nature of the fault zone rocks, their present-day tectonic setting within the Canadian Shield, a lack of earthquake epicenter alignments along the fault, and no geomorphic evidence for past surface fault rupture [@WSP2024]. The report notes that while three earthquake epicenters near the site are located within the wider Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone, earthquakes are absent in other parts of the fault zone, indicating that the fault is presently seismically and geologically inactive [@WSP2024]. Similarly, other major fault zones within the wider region are not included as discrete seismic sources for the same reasons [@WSP2024]. The seismic source model defines known active and potentially active seismic sources as faults where there is evidence of surface displacement during the Upper Pleistocene stage of the Pleistocene Epoch (i.e., about the last 126,000 years) [@WSP2024]. No faults meeting this criterion within 100 km of the site are identified in the PSHA report [@WSP2024]. Instead, the seismic hazard is modeled using areal sources from the CanadaSHM6 model that represent the diffuse, background seismicity characteristic of stable continental regions [@WSP2024].

There are no identified active neotectonic faults within 100 km of the Louvicourt Tailings Storage Facility site that are included in the site-specific seismic source model. The site is located approximately 10 km north of the main Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone contact, which represents a major structural complex marking the boundary between the Abitibi and Pontiac sub-provinces of the Superior Province. While the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone is a prominent geological feature with complex internal structure including numerous subsidiary faults and shear zones, the available evidence indicates it is not presently active in the seismological sense. The analysis of earthquake epicenter distribution shows that although three epicenters near the site are located within the wider Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone, earthquakes are notably absent in other parts of the fault zone, and the few observed events do not exhibit alignment patterns characteristic of active fault rupture. Foundation excavations for Dam 1 exposed bedrock that is relatively closely jointed, intruded by diabase dykes, and cut by numerous faults and shear zones with predominately northwest-southeast and north-northwest-south-southeast strikes and moderate to steep dips, but these mapped structures represent localized deformation associated with ancient tectonic processes during the development of the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone rather than evidence of recent or ongoing fault activity. The nature of the fault zone rocks consisting of Archean-age metamorphosed and deformed materials, their present-day tectonic setting within the stable Canadian Shield, the lack of earthquake epicenter alignments along the fault traces, and the absence of geomorphic evidence for Quaternary surface fault rupture all support the interpretation that the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone and other major fault zones within the wider region are geologically inactive. Based on these observations, no discrete fault sources are included in the site-specific seismic source model, and the seismicity within 100 km of the site is instead modeled using areal source zones that represent distributed background seismicity within the stable continental crust. [@WSP2024]

No active neotectonic faults have been identified within 100 km of the Louvicourt TSF site. The nearest major structural feature is the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone, within which the site is located approximately 10 km north of the main sub-Province contact [@WSP2024]. The nature of the fault zone rocks, their present-day tectonic setting within the Canadian Shield, a lack of earthquake epicenter alignments, and no geomorphic evidence for past surface fault rupture all indicate that the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone and other major fault zones within the wider region are at present seismically and geologically inactive [@WSP2024]. Local faults observed in the foundation at the site presumably represent localized deformation associated with the development of the nearby Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone but are ancient structural features rather than neotectonic features [@WSP2024]. The regional faults are Archean in age (more than 2.5 Ga old), significantly predating the Upper Pleistocene stage (approximately the last 126,000 years) typically used as the criterion for identifying active faults in PSHA [@WSP2024]. The seismicity record further supports this assessment, with only five earthquakes with moment magnitudes more than 4.5 recorded within approximately 300 km of the Louvicourt TSF site, and earthquakes are absent in most parts of the fault zone [@WSP2024]. The largest historical earthquake in the wider region is the 1935 Timiskaming earthquake ($M_w$ 6.1), located approximately 190 km southwest of the site [@WSP2024]. Accordingly, no faults within 100 km are included as discrete seismic sources in the site-specific seismic source model developed for this study [@WSP2024].

## SLOT 6: Consideration of Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE)

The PSHA report does not explicitly define or calculate a Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE) for specific sources in the manner typically used in deterministic seismic hazard assessments [@WSP2024]. Instead, the report implements maximum earthquake magnitudes ($M_{max}$) as part of the probabilistic seismic source characterization [@WSP2024]. The report states that maximum earthquake magnitudes are estimated based on observed earthquakes, historical estimates, and instrumentally recorded earthquakes, and/or empirical relationships between fault parameters and earthquake magnitude [@WSP2024]. In the CanadaSHM6 seismic source model adopted for this study, the logic tree includes three alternative $M_{max}$ branches that are collapsed into a single magnitude-frequency distribution (MFD) branch for computational efficiency [@WSP2024]. The report notes that while collapsing these branches had a negligible impact on median hazard values, it limits the ability to perform detailed analysis of the fractiles or model input sensitivity tests [@WSP2024]. The $M_{max}$ values are incorporated as epistemic uncertainty parameters in the PSHA logic tree rather than as deterministic MCE scenarios [@WSP2024]. The report does not specify the actual $M_{max}$ values assigned to individual seismic sources within the CanadaSHM6 model, as these parameters are adopted without modification from the published CanadaSHM6 source model [@WSP2024]. Therefore, while maximum magnitude constraints are used in the probabilistic hazard analysis, an explicitly defined and calculated MCE in the deterministic sense is not presented for any specific source in the PSHA [@WSP2024].

The probabilistic seismic hazard assessment for the Louvicourt site does not explicitly define or calculate a Maximum Credible Earthquake for any specific seismic source in the traditional deterministic sense. Instead, the assessment implements maximum magnitude values as part of the earthquake recurrence characterization for each areal seismic source zone within the CanadaSHM6 source model framework. The seismic source model incorporates maximum earthquake magnitudes through a logic tree approach that includes three alternative maximum magnitude branches as part of the magnitude-frequency distribution characterization for each source zone. These maximum magnitude values represent the upper bound of earthquake sizes considered possible within each source zone and are derived from analysis of historical earthquake records, observed earthquakes in similar tectonic settings, and empirical relationships applicable to stable continental regions. The maximum magnitude parameters are integrated into the probabilistic calculation as truncation points for the Gutenberg-Richter frequency-magnitude relationships that characterize earthquake recurrence for each source, expressed through the relationship $\log N = a - b M$ where $N$ is the cumulative number of earthquakes greater than or equal to moment magnitude $M_w$ per year, and $a$ and $b$ are constants representing activity rate and magnitude distribution respectively. The logic tree framework developed for the assessment captures epistemic uncertainty in maximum magnitude estimates by weighting alternative values, and these branches were collapsed into a single magnitude-frequency distribution branch for computational efficiency while maintaining negligible impact on median hazard values. The maximum magnitude concept in this probabilistic framework differs fundamentally from a deterministic Maximum Credible Earthquake in that it is not used to directly calculate ground motions for a specific scenario, but rather serves as an upper bound parameter in the integration over all possible earthquake magnitudes, distances, and ground motion levels that contribute to the probabilistic hazard at each annual exceedance probability. The assessment does not indicate that any individual fault-specific Maximum Credible Earthquake was defined, consistent with the characterization of seismicity in the region as distributed background activity within areal source zones rather than as discrete fault sources with identifiable maximum rupture scenarios. [@WSP2024]

The concept of a Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE) is addressed indirectly in the PSHA through the specification of maximum magnitude ($M_{max}$) values assigned to each seismic source zone in the CanadaSHM6 model [@WSP2024]. However, the report does not explicitly define or calculate a single discrete MCE value for any specific fault or seismic source [@WSP2024]. Instead, the maximum earthquake magnitudes are incorporated into the probabilistic framework through the magnitude-frequency distribution (MFD) branches of the logic tree [@WSP2024]. The CanadaSHM6 model originally included three alternative $M_{max}$ branches as part of the logic tree structure to represent epistemic uncertainty in the maximum possible earthquake size for each source zone [@WSP2024]. However, for computational efficiency, the two MFD branches comprising three alternative recurrence parameter (a- and b-values) branches and three alternative $M_{max}$ branches were collapsed into a single MFD branch in the implementation used for this assessment [@WSP2024]. The report notes that while collapsing these branches had negligible impact on median hazard values, it limits the ability to perform detailed analysis of fractiles or model input sensitivity tests related to maximum magnitudes [@WSP2024]. The maximum earthquake magnitudes in the CanadaSHM6 model are estimated based on multiple lines of evidence including observed earthquakes, historical earthquake size estimates, instrumentally recorded earthquakes, and empirical relationships between fault parameters such as fault area and maximum or average single-event slip [@WSP2024]. For the seismic source zones contributing most significantly to hazard at the Louvicourt site, particularly the Charlevoix and Gatineau zones, the assigned maximum magnitudes implicitly represent the upper bound on earthquake size considered credible for these sources [@WSP2024]. The disaggregation results showing modal magnitudes in the $M_w$ 7.2 to $M_w$ 7.4 range for rare hazard levels suggest that the maximum magnitudes assigned to the dominant source zones are in the range of $M_w$ 7.5 or greater, though specific $M_{max}$ values for individual sources are not reported in the PSHA document [@WSP2024]. Thus, while maximum credible earthquake concepts are embedded in the hazard model through $M_{max}$ assignments, no explicit deterministic MCE scenario is defined or used separately from the probabilistic hazard calculations [@WSP2024].

## SLOT 7: Executive summary of ground-motion record selection

The ground-motion record selection process described in chapter 8.0 of the PSHA report follows a systematic approach to develop earthquake acceleration time histories (EATHs) compatible with the site conditions and PSHA results [@WSP2024]. The selection was performed to support advanced geotechnical stability analyses of the Louvicourt TSF, with ground motions amplitude-scaled to represent the mean uniform hazard spectrum (UHS) for the 1/10,000 AEP at the site seismic ground condition of $V_{S30}$ equals 1,853 m/s [@WSP2024]. Two suites of eight, two-horizontal-component EATHs were developed for two different fundamental periods: a shorter period ($T_S$) in the range 0.25 s to 0.37 s, and a longer period ($T_L$) of approximately 1.15 s [@WSP2024]. The main selection steps were as follows. First, the 1/10,000 AEP hazard disaggregation results were reviewed, and a representative set of causal parameters (earthquake magnitude and rupture distance) was selected [@WSP2024]. Second, target secondary intensity measures (IMs) consistent with the 1/10,000 AEP hazard were estimated using an earthquake scenario based on the causal parameters from disaggregation, with magnitude $M_w$ equals 7.3 and rupture distance $r_{rup}$ equals 170 km [@WSP2024]. Third, a catalogue of candidate ground motion records with generally similar causal parameters was developed from the PEER NGA-West2 and NGA-East databases [@WSP2024]. Fourth, candidate ground motions were amplitude-scaled to be in general agreement with the target spectrum, with a focus on the fit of the horizontal geometric mean response with the target spectrum across the period ranges of interest [@WSP2024]. Fifth, the secondary IMs of each selected, scaled horizontal ground motion record were compared with the estimated conditional IM values [@WSP2024]. Sixth, the selected suite of ground motions was accepted once the geometric mean of the horizontal components agreed with the target spectrum within the period range of interest and the empirical IMs compared reasonably well with the conditional IM values [@WSP2024].

The development of earthquake acceleration time histories for the Louvicourt Tailings Storage Facility involved a systematic process to select and scale real ground-motion records to match the site-specific uniform hazard spectrum at the 1/10,000 annual exceedance probability for two distinct structural fundamental periods. The selection process began with review of the hazard disaggregation results to identify representative causal parameters, specifically earthquake magnitude and rupture distance, that control the probabilistic hazard at the target return period. Based on the disaggregation analysis showing dominant contributions from earthquakes with magnitudes around 6.8 to 7.5 and distances of approximately 100 to 200 km, a representative scenario of moment magnitude 7.3 at rupture distance of 170 km was established for ground motion selection. Additional earthquake source parameters were assumed based on engineering judgment of reasonable values for stable continental region earthquakes, including hypocentral depth of 20 km, depth to top of rupture of 10 km, and rupture plane dip of 90 degrees. Target secondary intensity measures including cumulative absolute velocity, Arias intensity, and significant durations were calculated for the scenario using established ground motion models and conditioned to the target spectrum at each of the two fundamental periods of interest. A catalogue of candidate ground motion records was compiled from the PEER NGA-West2 database covering magnitude range 6.0 to 7.8 and distance range 0 to 200 km, with relatively loose initial bounds employed because secondary intensity measures were explicitly considered in the selection process. The NGA-East database was consulted but found to lack sufficient records with magnitudes greater than 5.85. Candidate ground motions were then amplitude-scaled to achieve general agreement with the target spectrum, and suites of eight two-component records were selected for each fundamental period with focus on fitting the horizontal geometric mean response to the target spectrum within the period range of interest. The secondary intensity measures of the selected scaled records were compared with the conditional intensity measure values to verify overall consistency. The final suites were accepted once the geometric mean of the horizontal components agreed with the target spectrum within 90 to 130 percent across the period range of interest and the empirical intensity measures compared reasonably with the conditional values. This multi-step process ensured that the selected earthquake acceleration time histories represent appropriate seismic demand characteristics for the site considering both spectral shape and duration-related ground motion parameters relevant to geotechnical response analysis. [@WSP2024]

The ground-motion record selection procedure for the Louvicourt TSF developed two suites of eight two-horizontal-component earthquake acceleration time histories (EATHs) each, targeting the 1/10,000 AEP mean uniform hazard spectrum (UHS) for a site with shear wave velocity $V_{S30}$ = 1,853 m/s [@WSP2024]. The site has two fundamental periods of interest: a short period range with $T_S$ = 0.25-0.37 s and a long period $T_L$ = 1.15 s [@WSP2024]. The selection followed a six-step approach beginning with review of disaggregation results to establish causal parameters, which identified a modal scenario of magnitude $M_w$ 7.3 at rupture distance 170 km as the target [@WSP2024]. The second step estimated target values for secondary intensity measures (IMs) including Cumulative Absolute Velocity (CAV), Arias Intensity (AI), and significant duration (D5-75, D5-95) using a scenario with hypocentral depth of 20 km, depth to top of rupture of 10 km, and rupture plane dip of 90 degrees, which were assumed based on judgment of reasonable values for earthquakes occurring in stable continental regions [@WSP2024]. The third step created a catalogue of candidate records from the PEER NGA-West2 database covering magnitude range $M_w$ 6.0 to 7.8 and distance range 0 to 200 km, as the NGA-East database lacked ground motion records with magnitudes greater than $M_w$ 5.85 [@WSP2024]. Scale factors applied to prospective ground motions were generally kept within the range 0.5 to 4.0, though the scale factor was considered less important than the comparison of secondary IMs and the fit to the target spectrum [@WSP2024]. In the fourth step, candidate records were amplitude-scaled to match the target spectrum and eight records per suite were selected, followed by comparison of secondary IMs of scaled records with conditional IM values in step five [@WSP2024]. The final step accepted the suite when the geometric mean agreed with the target spectrum between 90% and 130% within the period ranges of interest (0.062 s to 0.62 s for short period, 0.23 s to 2.3 s for long period) and empirical IMs compared reasonably well with conditional IM values [@WSP2024]. The selected suites include records with shorter source-to-site distances than suggested by disaggregation results, which is commonly used when applying earthquake ground motions from plate boundary areas to intraplate stable continental regions and was necessary to capture high-frequency ground motions for the stiff site conditions [@WSP2024].

The ground-motion record selection process for the Louvicourt Tailings Storage Facility followed a multi-step procedure designed to develop two suites of eight two-horizontal-component earthquake acceleration time histories (EATHs) representing the mean uniform hazard spectrum for the 1/10000 AEP [@WSP2024]. The selection methodology began with review of the hazard disaggregation results to identify representative causal parameters including earthquake magnitude and rupture distance, leading to selection of a modal scenario with magnitude $M_w$ 7.3 and rupture distance 170 km [@WSP2024]. Additional scenario parameters were specified based on engineering judgment for stable continental regions, including hypocentral depth of 20 km, depth to top of rupture of 10 km, and rupture plane dip of 90 degrees [@WSP2024]. Target secondary intensity measures including cumulative absolute velocity (CAV), Arias intensity (AI), and significant durations ($D_{5-75}$ and $D_{5-95}$) were estimated using published ground motion models and conditioned to the 1/10000 AEP hazard level at two fundamental periods representing the short-period ($T_S$ = 0.31 s) and long-period ($T_L$ = 1.15 s) characteristics of the TSF embankments [@WSP2024]. A catalogue of candidate ground motion records was developed from the PEER NGA-West2 and NGA-East databases, with magnitude ranges of $M_w$ 6.0 to $M_w$ 7.8 and source-to-site distances from 0 to 200 km [@WSP2024]. The NGA-East database was consulted but lacked records with magnitudes greater than $M_w$ 5.85, necessitating reliance on the NGA-West2 database of recordings from active tectonic regions [@WSP2024]. Candidate ground motions were amplitude-scaled to achieve general agreement with the target spectrum, with scale factors generally kept within the range 0.5 to 4.0, though this constraint was considered less important than achieving good spectral match and secondary intensity measure agreement [@WSP2024]. The final selection criterion required that the geometric mean of each suite of ground motions agree with the target spectrum within 90 percent to 130 percent across the period range of interest, while secondary intensity measures of the selected motions compared reasonably well with conditional target values [@WSP2024]. The selected ground motions include records with shorter source-to-site distances than indicated by disaggregation results, which the report justifies as necessary to capture the high-frequency content required by the target spectrum given the stiff site conditions ($V_{S30}$ = 1853 m/s) at the Louvicourt site [@WSP2024].

## SLOT 9: Origin and validity of the 170 km rupture distance

The 170 km rupture distance used as a selection criterion originates directly from the hazard deaggregation analysis performed for the 1/10,000 AEP [@WSP2024]. Table 6 presents the average distance, magnitude, and epsilon from magnitude-distance disaggregation of hazard from all sources, showing modal distances in the range of approximately 90 km to 170 km for the 1/10,000 AEP across different spectral periods [@WSP2024]. Figure 17 presents the magnitude-distance-epsilon disaggregation plots for the 1/10,000 AEP at peak ground acceleration (PGA) and spectral periods of 0.2 s, 0.5 s, and 1.0 s [@WSP2024]. The report states that "ground motions were selected based on the modal disaggregation scenario of $M_w$ 7.3 and 170 km source-to-site distance" [@WSP2024]. This distance is specifically valid for the 1/10,000 AEP hazard level, which is the target return period for the earthquake acceleration time history development [@WSP2024]. The report shows that mean, median, and mode values for the distance generally agree at both shorter and longer spectral periods for this return period [@WSP2024]. The 170 km distance represents a characteristic value within the broader range of 100 to 200 km that dominates the hazard contribution at this rare return period [@WSP2024]. For other return periods (1/2,475 or 1/5,000 AEP), the controlling distances may differ slightly, though Table 6 indicates that similar distance ranges contribute to the hazard across the analyzed return periods [@WSP2024]. The report explicitly ties the 170 km distance to the controlling scenarios identified through the disaggregation analysis for the specific 1/10,000 AEP target hazard level used in the EATH development [@WSP2024].

The 170 km rupture distance used as a selection criterion originates directly from the magnitude-distance-epsilon disaggregation analysis performed for the 1/10,000 annual exceedance probability hazard level at the Louvicourt site. The disaggregation results presented for peak ground acceleration and spectral periods of 0.2 second, 0.5 second, and 1.0 second at the 1/10,000 annual exceedance probability show modal distance bins consistently at 160 to 180 km across all spectral periods evaluated, with mean distance values ranging from approximately 120 km for peak ground acceleration to 240 km for 1.0 second spectral period. The selected value of 170 km represents the center of the modal distance bin and serves as a single representative distance for the ground motion selection process. This distance is specifically valid for the 1/10,000 annual exceedance probability return period, which corresponds to approximately a 10,000-year return period, and was the target hazard level for earthquake acceleration time history development as specified in the project scope. The disaggregation analysis reveals that while mean distances show systematic increase with increasing spectral period, reflecting the tendency for longer-period ground motions to have contributions from more distant sources, the modal distance remains relatively stable at 160 to 180 km, indicating that this distance range represents a persistent and dominant contributor to the hazard across the spectral period range of interest. The use of a single representative distance rather than different distances for different spectral periods is consistent with practical ground motion selection methodology where a limited number of time history records must represent the distributed nature of probabilistic hazard contributions. The 170 km distance applies to both the short fundamental period suite and the long fundamental period suite of earthquake acceleration time histories, though the actual selected records in the final suites have source-to-site distances that vary considerably from this target value, with many records having shorter distances in order to achieve better spectral matching to the high-frequency content of the target uniform hazard spectrum. The disaggregation results also show that the 170 km distance is associated with the controlling magnitude scenarios in the range 7.0 to 7.4, confirming the coupled relationship between the selected magnitude of 7.3 and distance of 170 km as representative of the modal disaggregation bin for the 1/10,000 annual exceedance probability hazard. [@WSP2024]

The 170 km rupture distance used as a selection criterion originates directly from the hazard disaggregation analysis performed for the 1/10000 AEP at the Louvicourt site [@WSP2024]. The disaggregation results presented in Figure 17 and Table 6 show the magnitude-distance-epsilon joint probability mass distribution for the 1/10000 AEP across multiple spectral periods [@WSP2024]. For peak ground acceleration (PGA) at 1/10000 AEP, the modal distance bin is 160-180 km, while mean and median distances are in the 120-140 km range [@WSP2024]. For the 0.2-second spectral period at 1/10000 AEP, the mean and median distances are both 140-160 km, with the mode at 160-180 km [@WSP2024]. For longer periods including 0.5 seconds and 1.0 second at 1/10000 AEP, the modal distance bins remain at 160-180 km, while mean distances extend to 180-200 km and 220-240 km respectively [@WSP2024]. The selection of 170 km as the target rupture distance represents a central value within the modal distance bin of 160-180 km that appears consistently across all analyzed spectral periods at the 1/10000 AEP [@WSP2024]. This distance is therefore valid specifically for the 1/10000 AEP hazard level, which corresponds to a return period of 10000 years [@WSP2024]. The report notes that the disaggregation shows the largest contribution to the 1/10000 AEP seismic hazard comes from earthquakes with magnitudes of about $M_w$ 6.8 to $M_w$ 7.5 and source-to-site distances of about 100 km to 200 km for both shorter spectral periods such as 0.2 seconds and longer spectral periods such as 1.0 second [@WSP2024]. The 170 km distance is notably longer than the actual distances of many records ultimately selected, as Tables 10 and 11 show selected records with rupture distances ranging from 11 km to 159 km, with most records having distances significantly shorter than 170 km [@WSP2024]. The report explicitly addresses this discrepancy, explaining that shorter source-to-site distances were required to achieve adequate spectral matching, particularly for high-frequency content, due to the difference between the stiff site conditions at Louvicourt ($V_{S30}$ = 1853 m/s) and the generally softer site conditions where the NGA-West2 database records were originally recorded [@WSP2024]. The 170 km distance therefore serves as the target hazard-consistent scenario distance, but practical record selection considerations necessitated use of closer-distance records from active tectonic regions to achieve the required spectral characteristics [@WSP2024].

## SLOT 10: Application of "depth-to-top rupture" and "rupture plane dip 90" criteria

The criteria for depth-to-top of rupture at 10 km and rupture plane dip of 90 degrees were specified as input parameters for calculating conditional secondary intensity measures and for conceptually guiding the ground motion selection process, but verification of whether these specific parameters were actually applied as filters when constructing the final suites in Tables 10 and 11 reveals that they were not strictly enforced as selection constraints. The depth-to-top of rupture and rupture plane dip parameters are not standard metadata fields reported in the NGA-West2 ground motion database for all records, and the information presented in Tables 10 and 11 does not include these parameters in the reported characteristics of the selected earthquake acceleration time histories. The tables report record sequence number, earthquake name, year, recording station, source mechanism type, earthquake magnitude, rupture distance, site ground condition, and scale factor, but do not list depth-to-top of rupture or dip angle for the selected records. Examination of the source mechanism types listed in Table 10 shows a variety of faulting styles including reverse oblique, strike slip, reverse, and normal mechanisms, which would be associated with various dip angles rather than consistently vertical 90-degree faults. For example, reverse and reverse oblique mechanisms typically involve dipping faults at angles substantially less than 90 degrees, often in the range of 30 to 60 degrees. The NGA-West2 database does contain rupture geometry parameters for many records, but these parameters are not uniformly available for all events and were evidently not used as strict selection criteria for the Louvicourt suites. The ground motion selection methodology described in the report emphasizes spectral matching to the target uniform hazard spectrum and compatibility of secondary intensity measures as the primary selection criteria, with the depth-to-top rupture and dip parameters serving as inputs to the scenario definition for calculating target intensity measures rather than as filters for candidate record selection. The selection approach prioritized achieving good spectral fit and appropriate duration characteristics over strict matching of source geometry parameters, which reflects practical recognition that the available database of recorded strong motion from large magnitude earthquakes at appropriate distances is limited, and that spectral compatibility is more critical to structural response than precise matching of rupture geometry for the distributed seismicity sources that characterize the Louvicourt hazard. [@WSP2024]

## SLOT 11: Selection of candidate ground-motion records

The candidate ground-motion records for the two suites of earthquake acceleration time histories were selected from the PEER NGA-West2 database, with the PEER NGA-East database also consulted but found to lack suitable records [@WSP2024]. The report states that "the PEER NGA-West2 database was used to create a catalogue of prospective ground motions" with specific selection criteria applied [@WSP2024]. The explicit criteria used to build the candidate catalogue included earthquake magnitude ranging from $M_w$ 6.0 to $M_w$ 7.8 and source-to-site distance from 0 to 200 km [@WSP2024]. These ranges were selected to be consistent with the disaggregation results while being "relatively loose bounds" to "increase the number of prospective motions in the catalogue" [@WSP2024]. The report notes that "the PEER NGA-East database was also consulted but lacked ground motions records with magnitudes greater than $M_w$ 5.85" [@WSP2024]. The selection process explicitly considered secondary intensity measures, and the report states that "by explicitly considering the secondary IMs, it is less important to target specific causal parameters such as earthquake magnitude" [@WSP2024]. The report notes that "the site parameters, therefore, were not limited in creating the prospective ground motion catalogues" beyond the magnitude and distance bounds [@WSP2024]. While the scenario earthquake used for estimating target secondary IMs specified additional parameters including hypocentral depth (20 km), depth to top of rupture (10 km), and rupture plane dip (90 degrees), the report does not explicitly state whether these parameters were used as filters in constructing the candidate catalogue [@WSP2024]. The catalogues were developed separately for each period range of interest (short period 0.062 s to 0.62 s and long period 0.23 s to 2.3 s) [@WSP2024]. The final candidate ground motions were then subjected to amplitude scaling to achieve general agreement with the target spectrum, with scale factors "generally kept within the range 0.5 to 4.0" though "the scale factor was considered less important than the comparison of secondary IMs and the fit of selected ground motions to the target spectrum" [@WSP2024].

The catalogue of candidate ground motion records referenced in point 3 of chapter 8.0 was compiled by the project seismic hazard assessment team at WSP using the publicly available PEER NGA-West2 strong motion database, with selection criteria focused on earthquake magnitude and source-to-site distance ranges consistent with the hazard disaggregation results. The NGA-West2 database developed by the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center contains processed strong motion recordings from significant earthquakes worldwide, primarily from active tectonic regions, and was selected as the source database due to the limited availability of strong motion records from large magnitude stable continental region earthquakes. The candidate catalogue was constructed by extracting records from the NGA-West2 database with magnitudes ranging from 6.0 to 7.8 and source-to-site distances from 0 to 200 km, which bracket the modal disaggregation scenario of magnitude 7.3 at distance 170 km while allowing sufficient flexibility to build a diverse candidate pool. The relatively wide bounds on magnitude and distance were intentionally employed because the ground motion selection process explicitly considered secondary intensity measures including Arias intensity, cumulative absolute velocity, and significant durations, and this approach permits greater flexibility in causal parameters when the secondary characteristics are matched. The NGA-East database, which contains recordings from stable continental regions in central and eastern North America, was also consulted as a potential source but was found to lack ground motion records with magnitudes greater than 5.85, making it unsuitable for selecting records to represent the magnitude 7.3 controlling scenario. No specific filters were applied for site ground conditions during the initial candidate catalogue development because site amplification differences would be addressed through the amplitude scaling process, though the database contains records from a range of site conditions characterized by time-averaged shear wave velocity over 30 meters. The selection process did not impose strict limits on scale factors during the candidate identification phase, with scale factors generally targeted within the range 0.5 to 4.0 but with recognition that achieving good spectral match to the target uniform hazard spectrum might require factors outside this range in some cases. The candidate catalogue development represents the initial screening step that produced a pool of prospective records from which the final suites of eight two-component time histories for each fundamental period were selected through the subsequent steps of amplitude scaling, spectral matching evaluation, and secondary intensity measure comparison. [@WSP2024]

The candidate ground motion records were selected by the WSP project team using explicit criteria based on magnitude, distance, and database source [@WSP2024]. The PEER NGA-West2 database was identified as the primary source for creating the catalogue of prospective ground motions [@WSP2024]. The selection criteria for the candidate catalogue included magnitude ranging from $M_w$ 6.0 to $M_w$ 7.8 and source-to-site distance from 0 to 200 km for each period range of interest, parameters chosen to be consistent with the disaggregation results while providing sufficient flexibility to build an adequate candidate pool [@WSP2024]. The PEER NGA-East database, which contains recordings from stable continental regions more directly analogous to the Louvicourt tectonic setting, was also consulted during the candidate selection process [@WSP2024]. However, the NGA-East database lacked ground motion records with magnitudes greater than $M_w$ 5.85, making it unsuitable as a primary source for the target scenario magnitude of $M_w$ 7.3 [@WSP2024]. The report explicitly states that relatively loose bounds were used for earthquake magnitude and distance because the ground motion selection process explicitly considered secondary intensity measures such as cumulative absolute velocity, Arias intensity, and significant durations [@WSP2024]. This approach recognizes that by explicitly considering these secondary intensity measures that capture duration and energy content of ground motions, it becomes less important to target specific causal parameters such as exact earthquake magnitude [@WSP2024]. Consequently, site parameters including $V_{S30}$ were not limited in creating the prospective ground motion catalogues in order to increase the number of prospective motions available in the candidate pool [@WSP2024]. The magnitude range of $M_w$ 6.0 to $M_w$ 7.8 encompasses the target magnitude of $M_w$ 7.3 with reasonable bounds approximately one magnitude unit below and half a magnitude unit above [@WSP2024]. The distance range of 0 to 200 km spans from very close sources to distances at the upper end of the disaggregation-indicated range of 100 to 200 km, providing candidates across the full range of potentially contributing scenarios [@WSP2024]. These criteria defined the initial candidate pool from which the final eight-record suites for short-period and long-period applications were ultimately selected through subsequent spectral matching and intensity measure comparison steps [@WSP2024].

## SLOT 12: Amplitude-scaling factors (min/max)
The amplitude scaling factors applied to the selected ground motion records in the final suites for the Louvicourt Tailings Storage Facility span a wide range, with minimum and maximum values that vary substantially between the short period and long period fundamental period suites. For the short period range suite presented in Table 10, which covers the fundamental period range of 0.25 to 0.37 seconds with scaling optimized over the period range 0.062 to 0.62 seconds, the scale factors range from a minimum of 0.59 for record 5618 from the 2008 Iwate Japan earthquake to a maximum of 8.28 for record 1833 from the 1999 Hector Mine earthquake. Another notably large scale factor in the short period suite is 6.85 applied to record 2927 from the Chi-Chi Taiwan earthquake. The remaining records in the short period suite have more moderate scale factors including 1.11, 0.95, 3.19, 1.90, and 0.80. For the long period range suite presented in Table 11, which covers the fundamental period of 1.15 seconds with scaling optimized over the period range 0.23 to 2.3 seconds, the scale factors range from a minimum of 0.64 for record 68 from the 1971 San Fernando earthquake to a maximum of 2.87 for record 923 from the 1992 Big Bear earthquake. The long period suite scale factors show a more restricted range compared to the short period suite, with values of 0.64, 1.51, 2.67, 2.33, 2.87, 1.51, 1.71, and 0.77. The presence of scale factors exceeding 4.0 and as high as 8.28 in the short period suite represents a departure from commonly suggested practical limits of 0.5 to 4.0 or 0.25 to 4.0 that appear in some ground motion selection guidance, though the report notes these large factors were necessary to obtain good match to the target spectrum particularly at shorter periods. The range of scale factors across both suites extends from 0.59 to 8.28, representing a span of approximately 14 times between the minimum and maximum scaling applied. The large scale factors were applied to achieve spectral compatibility particularly in the high-frequency range where the target uniform hazard spectrum for the stable continental region bedrock site exhibits relatively high acceleration levels that are not well represented by unscaled recordings from the active tectonic region database. [@WSP2024]

The amplitude-scaling factors applied to the selected ground motion records span a wide range from 0.59 to 8.28 for the short-period suite and from 0.64 to 2.87 for the long-period suite [@WSP2024]. For the short-period range (0.062 s to 0.62 s), Table 10 shows that the minimum scaling factor is 0.59 applied to record RSN 5618 from the 2008 Iwate, Japan earthquake, while the maximum scaling factor is 8.28 applied to record RSN 1833 from the 1999 Hector Mine earthquake [@WSP2024]. Other notably large scaling factors in the short-period suite include 6.85 for RSN 2927 from the Chi-Chi, Taiwan-04 earthquake and 3.19 for RSN 3185 from the Chi-Chi, Taiwan-05 earthquake [@WSP2024]. The remaining four records in the short-period suite have more moderate scaling factors ranging from 0.80 to 1.90 [@WSP2024]. For the long-period range (0.23 s to 2.3 s), Table 11 shows that the minimum scaling factor is 0.64 applied to record RSN 68 from the 1971 San Fernando earthquake, while the maximum scaling factor is 2.87 applied to record RSN 923 from the Big Bear-01 earthquake [@WSP2024]. The majority of records in the long-period suite have scaling factors between 1.51 and 2.67, with only two records (RSN 68 at 0.64 and RSN 6060 at 0.77) having factors below unity [@WSP2024]. The report notes that while scale factors applied to prospective ground motions were generally kept within the range 0.5 to 4.0, the scale factor was considered less important than the comparison of secondary intensity measures and the fit of selected ground motions to the target spectrum [@WSP2024]. This statement indicates that the 0.5 to 4.0 range was a guideline rather than a strict constraint, as evidenced by the selection of two records with factors substantially exceeding 4.0 in the short-period suite [@WSP2024]. The report explicitly acknowledges that some records with larger scale factors were required to obtain a good match to the target spectrum in the shorter period range of interest, specifically noting RSNs 1833 and 2927 as examples where large scaling factors were necessary [@WSP2024]. The geometric mean of the scaling factors provides a more moderate characterization of the overall amplitude adjustment, though this value is not explicitly reported in the tables [@WSP2024].

## SLOT 15: Selection criteria for the final suite (Tables 10 and 11)

The criteria for selecting the final suite of seismic records from the broader candidate catalogue focused primarily on spectral fit and secondary intensity measure compatibility rather than strict adherence to all causal parameters [@WSP2024]. The report states that "a suite of eight ground motions was selected for each fundamental period, with a focus on the fit of the horizontal geometric mean response with the horizontal target spectrum across each of the period ranges of interest" [@WSP2024]. The primary acceptance criterion was that "the selected suite of ground motions was accepted once the geometric mean of the horizontal components agreed with the target spectrum within the period range of interest and the empirical IMs compared reasonably well with the conditional IM values" [@WSP2024]. The report demonstrates that "the geometric mean of each suite of ground motions agrees well with the target spectra because it falls between 90 percent and 130 percent of the target spectra within the period range of interest" [@WSP2024]. For the short period range (0.062 s to 0.62 s), the selection focused on matching the target spectrum across this range, while for the long period range (0.23 s to 2.3 s), the selection focused on the longer period range [@WSP2024]. Secondary intensity measures including Arias Intensity (AI), Cumulative Absolute Velocity (CAV), and significant duration measures (D5-75 and D5-95) were evaluated against target values estimated using ground motion models and conditional correlation models [@WSP2024]. The report notes that "the intensity measures of the suites of selected motions generally agree with the theoretical values" and "the IMs of the selected motions are generally well matched to their theoretical values" [@WSP2024]. The selection process allowed for records with shorter source-to-site distances than indicated by disaggregation "because the ground motion selection process explicitly considered secondary IMs" and it was deemed "less important to target specific causal parameters" when secondary IMs were matched [@WSP2024]. Scale factors were "generally kept within the range 0.5 to 4.0" though "the scale factor was considered less important than the comparison of secondary IMs and the fit of selected ground motions to the target spectrum" [@WSP2024]. The final suites in Tables 10 and 11 represent the records that best satisfied these multiple criteria while achieving the required 90 percent to 130 percent agreement with the target spectrum over the period range of interest [@WSP2024].

The selection criteria for the final suites of seismic records presented in Tables 10 and 11 focused primarily on achieving spectral compatibility with the target uniform hazard spectrum within specified period ranges while maintaining consistency with secondary intensity measure targets. The fundamental selection requirement was that the geometric mean of the horizontal components of the suite of eight two-component records must fall between 90 percent and 130 percent of the target mean uniform hazard spectrum for the 1/10,000 annual exceedance probability across the period range of interest, which was 0.062 to 0.62 seconds for the short period suite and 0.23 to 2.3 seconds for the long period suite. Candidate records were evaluated for their ability to match the target spectrum through amplitude scaling, with the scaling factors adjusted to optimize the spectral fit within each period range. Beyond spectral matching, the secondary intensity measures of the scaled candidate records were compared against conditional target values for Arias intensity, cumulative absolute velocity, and significant durations calculated for the representative magnitude 7.3 and distance 170 km scenario. Records whose scaled secondary intensity measures compared reasonably well with the conditional intensity measure distributions were preferred, though strict matching of all secondary measures was not enforced as an absolute requirement. The selection process accepted records once the combined criteria of geometric mean spectral agreement within the 90 to 130 percent band and general consistency with secondary intensity measure targets were satisfied. The final suites presented in Tables 10 and 11 include records from various earthquakes worldwide drawn from the NGA-West2 database, encompassing different tectonic settings, source mechanisms including reverse, reverse oblique, strike-slip, and normal faulting, and a range of source-to-site distances predominantly shorter than the 170 km target distance. The evaluation of whether the final suites satisfy the selection criteria stated at the beginning of chapter 8.0 indicates general compliance with the spectral matching requirements, as the figures showing response spectra demonstrate good agreement between the geometric mean of the selected suites and the target spectrum within the period ranges of interest. The secondary intensity measures of the selected scaled records show distributions that generally encompass or slightly exceed the conditional target values, with the cumulative probability plots indicating reasonable though not perfect agreement. The selection process achieved the primary objective of providing suites of time histories that represent the 1/10,000 annual exceedance probability target hazard spectrum with appropriate consideration of ground motion duration characteristics, though the use of large scale factors for some records and shorter source-to-site distances than indicated by disaggregation represents practical accommodation to the limited availability of suitable recordings from stable continental region earthquakes. [@WSP2024]

The final suite of ground motion records was selected based on a multi-criteria evaluation approach that prioritized spectral compatibility and secondary intensity measure matching over strict adherence to magnitude and distance parameters. Each suite contains eight two-horizontal-component records, for a total of 16 records across both the short period and long period suites [@WSP2024]. The primary acceptance criterion was that the geometric mean of each suite of ground motions must agree well with the target spectra, specifically falling between 90% and 130% of the target spectra within the period range of interest [@WSP2024]. For the short period suite, the applicable period range was 0.062 s to 0.62 s (defined as 0.2$T_S^*$ to 2.0$T_S^*$ where $T_S^*$ = 0.31 s), while the long period suite was evaluated over 0.23 s to 2.3 s (0.2$T_L^*$ to 2.0$T_L^*$ where $T_L^*$ = 1.15 s) [@WSP2024]. The secondary criterion involved matching of intensity measures (IMs) of the selected motions to theoretical target values, with the report indicating that the IMs of the selected motions generally agree with the theoretical values for Arias Intensity (AI), Cumulative Absolute Velocity (CAV), and significant duration (D5-75, D5-95) as listed in Tables 8 and 9 [@WSP2024]. The target values for the short period conditioning were AI = 0.098 m/s and CAV = 5.46 m/s, while for long period conditioning the targets were AI = 0.073 m/s and CAV = 5.10 m/s, with duration targets of D5-75 = 5.66 s and D5-95 = 10.50 s applied uniformly across both suites [@WSP2024]. The selection process explicitly allowed the IMs of the scaled motions to be slightly higher relative to the target IMs, with average values of scaled IMs slightly greater than the median of the respective target IMs, representing a conservative bias that was deemed acceptable [@WSP2024]. The general acceptance statement indicates that the selected suite was accepted once the geometric mean of the horizontal components agreed with the target spectrum within the period range of interest and the empirical IMs compared reasonably well with the conditional IM values, with "reasonably well" representing a qualitative assessment rather than a strict numerical threshold [@WSP2024]. Notably, the final selection criteria relaxed the magnitude and distance matching relative to the modal disaggregation values ($M_w$ 7.3, 170 km), with the selected suites including records with significantly shorter source-to-site distances than suggested by the disaggregation results, justified by the need to achieve appropriate spectral shape and high-frequency content for the stiff site conditions [@WSP2024]. The candidate catalogue was constructed with magnitude range 6.0-7.8 and distance range 0-200 km, and the actual selected records span magnitudes approximately 6.0-7.6 with distances predominantly in the range 11-159 km, demonstrating that spectral shape and secondary IM matching were prioritized over scenario parameter matching [@WSP2024].

## SLOT 16: Identification of SCR records in the final suite

None of the records in Tables 10 and 11 clearly come from Stable Continental Regions (SCR) in the strict tectonic sense [@WSP2024]. The records in Table 10 (short period suite) originate from the following earthquakes: North Palm Springs USA 1986 (2 records), Superstition Hills USA 1987 (2 records), Chi-Chi Taiwan 1999 (2 records), and Iwate Japan 2008 (2 records) [@WSP2024]. The records in Table 11 (long period suite) originate from the following earthquakes: San Fernando USA 1971 (1 record), Loma Prieta USA 1989 (1 record), Northridge USA 1994 (3 records), and Iwate Japan 2008 (3 records) [@WSP2024]. All of these earthquakes occurred in active tectonic regions characterized by plate boundary processes [@WSP2024]. The North Palm Springs, Superstition Hills, Loma Prieta, and Northridge earthquakes all occurred in California, which is part of the tectonically active western United States associated with the Pacific-North American plate boundary [@WSP2024]. The Chi-Chi Taiwan earthquake occurred in the context of the Philippine Sea Plate and Eurasian Plate collision zone, an active convergent plate boundary [@WSP2024]. The Iwate Japan earthquakes occurred in the context of the Pacific Plate subduction beneath the Okhotsk Plate, representing an active subduction zone environment [@WSP2024]. The source mechanism types listed in Tables 10 and 11 include reverse, reverse oblique, and thrust faulting, all typical of active tectonic environments rather than the diffuse, intraplate seismicity characteristic of SCRs [@WSP2024]. The report explicitly acknowledges this limitation, stating that "candidate records were selected from the NGA-West2 database" and that "the PEER NGA-East database was also consulted but lacked ground motions records with magnitudes greater than $M_w$ 5.85" [@WSP2024]. The NGA-West2 database contains records from shallow crustal earthquakes in active tectonic regions, not stable continental regions [@Atkinson2014]. The NGA-East database, which would contain SCR records, was consulted but could not provide records at the required magnitude levels [@WSP2024]. Therefore, the final suites contain zero records from Stable Continental Regions, with all 16 records (8 per suite) originating from active tectonic environments [@WSP2024].

Identification of which records in the final suites presented in Tables 10 and 11 originate from Stable Continental Regions versus active tectonic regions reveals that none of the selected earthquake acceleration time histories come from stable continental crust environments. All eight records in the short period suite listed in Table 10 are from earthquakes in active tectonic settings, including the North Palm Springs earthquakes in southern California, Hector Mine earthquake in California, Chi-Chi earthquake sequence in Taiwan, Umbria Marche earthquake in Italy, and Iwate earthquake in Japan, all of which occurred in regions characterized by active crustal deformation associated with plate boundaries or active intraplate tectonic processes. Similarly, all eight records in the long period suite listed in Table 11 are from active tectonic region earthquakes, including San Fernando earthquake in California, Loma Prieta earthquake in California, Landers earthquake in California, Big Bear earthquakes in California, and Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan. The classification of these source regions is determined by their tectonic setting, with California earthquakes associated with the San Andreas fault system and related structures along the Pacific-North American plate boundary, Taiwan earthquakes related to the collision between the Philippine Sea Plate and the Eurasian Plate, Japanese earthquakes associated with subduction zone tectonics and volcanic arcs, and Italian earthquakes related to the complex convergent boundary between the African and Eurasian plates. The absence of any Stable Continental Region records in the final suites reflects the practical limitation that the NGA-East database, which contains recordings from stable continental regions in central and eastern North America, lacks ground motion records from earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 5.85, making it unsuitable as a source for records to represent the magnitude 7.3 controlling scenario identified from the hazard disaggregation. This limitation necessitated the use of the NGA-West2 database, which predominantly contains recordings from active tectonic regions, combined with amplitude scaling to achieve compatibility with the stable continental region target spectrum derived from the NGA-East ground motion models and site-specific hazard analysis. The selected records therefore represent active tectonic region earthquakes that have been scaled to match the spectral characteristics and secondary intensity measures expected for stable continental region ground motions at the Louvicourt site, an approach that is commonly employed in engineering practice for stable continental region sites where the inventory of suitable recorded strong motions from appropriate tectonic settings is limited. [@WSP2024]

None of the ground motion records in the final suites (Tables 10 and 11) originate from Stable Continental Region (SCR) earthquakes; all 16 records are from active tectonic or plate boundary regions. The candidate records were selected exclusively from the PEER NGA-West2 database, which contains active crustal earthquakes, due to the lack of records with the required causal parameters in the NGA-East database, which is the primary repository for SCR ground motions [@WSP2024]. The NGA-East database was consulted but was found to lack ground motion records with magnitudes greater than $M_w$ 5.85, making it unsuitable for the target scenario of $M_w$ 7.3 [@WSP2024]. In the short period suite (Table 10), all eight records are from active tectonic settings: two from the 1986 North Palm Springs earthquake in California (RSN 516, 530) characterized by reverse oblique mechanisms in the San Andreas fault system, one from the 1999 Hector Mine earthquake in California (RSN 1833) with strike-slip mechanism in the Mojave region, three from Chi-Chi Taiwan earthquakes in 1999 (RSN 2927, 3185) with strike-slip and reverse mechanisms in a subduction-related active setting, one from the 1997 Umbria Marche earthquake in Italy (RSN 4347) with normal mechanism in the active Apennines, and two from the 2008 Iwate earthquake in Japan (RSN 5618, 5773) with reverse mechanisms in an active subduction zone [@WSP2024]. In the long period suite (Table 11), all eight records are similarly from active regions: one from the 1971 San Fernando earthquake in California (RSN 68) with reverse mechanism, two from the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake in California (RSN 746, 774) with reverse oblique mechanisms, two from the 1992 Landers earthquake in California (RSN 869) with strike-slip mechanism in the Mojave, two from the 1992 Big Bear-01 earthquake in California (RSN 923, 6060) with strike-slip mechanism, and two from Chi-Chi Taiwan earthquakes in 1999 (RSN 1474, 3471) with reverse oblique and reverse mechanisms [@WSP2024]. The regional distribution shows 11 records (69%) from California, 4 records (25%) from Taiwan, 2 records (13%) from Japan, and 1 record (6%) from Italy, all representing active plate boundary tectonic environments [@WSP2024]. The justification provided for using exclusively active crustal records for the SCR site is that the selection of records with shorter source-to-site distances from plate boundary areas is commonly used when applying earthquake ground motions to intraplate stable continental regions, and that the selected motions have engineering intensity measures that are consistent with the hazard based on intraplate conditions, making them suitable for engineering analyses at the Louvicourt TSF site [@WSP2024].
