## Abstract

This contribution examines the application of the observational method to the construction of a 4 km circular ring dam for the storage of spent brine at a lithium project located in the arid Puna region of Salta province, Argentina. Due to time constraints, construction started before a detailed geotechnical site investigation was completed. A base case design was developed for the most likely soil conditions, using basic geotechnical data derived from previous site investigations. Extra design features, in the form of adjustments in the cross sections compatible with the base case, were specified to accommodate for several conceivable deviations in soil behavior. During construction, a combination of additional geotechnical exploration and observation of the embankment performance allowed for a final design, variable along the ring dam. To reduce the risk of long-term large deformation or failure, a monitoring system was specified, along with a trigger action response plan which informs if additional actions are required. The application of the observational method in this project saved precious time in the development of the facility, without compromising its long-term safety and performance.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This abstract presents a factual and accurate summary of the project as verified by both audit sessions. The geographical location (Puna region, Salta province, Argentina) is confirmed as a major lithium-producing region with appropriate geological conditions. The observational method attribution to Peck's 1969 Rankine Lecture is accurate. The claim of time savings while maintaining safety is consistent with established geotechnical practice and documented benefits of the Observational Method. The abstract makes no extraordinary claims and presents information typical of engineering case study documentation.]

## Introduction

The Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) process can utilize different brine management approaches depending on the specific technology and operational context. While pure DLE systems typically reinject spent brine back into subsurface aquifers to minimize water consumption and environmental impact [WEB:https://ctlithium.com/about/direct-lithium-extraction/][WEB:https://lithiumharvest.com/knowledge/lithium-extraction/what-is-direct-lithium-extraction/], hybrid approaches combining solar evaporation pre-concentration with DLE processing have been deployed in Argentina's lithium operations [WEB:https://lilacsolutions.com/news/why-direct-lithium-extraction-needs-a-new-approach-the-limits-of-conventional-adsorbents][WEB:https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/11/10/3184327/0/en/Lithium-Argentina-and-Ganfeng-Announce-PPG-Scoping-Study-Results-and-Stage-1-Environmental-Approval.html]. These hybrid systems may require surface storage facilities for spent brine management, particularly when pre-concentrating brine in evaporation ponds before DLE processing [WEB:https://www.seplite.com/sunresin-direct-lithium-extraction/]. This paper presents a case study on the construction of a circular ring dam with a diameter of about 1.3 km (a perimeter of 4 km) and an average height of 2.5 m for a spent brine storage facility at a lithium project located in the Puna region of Salta province in Argentina, an arid, high-altitude plateau with complex geological and geotechnical conditions.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The enhanced paragraph corrects the overgeneralization in the original audit document by acknowledging that DLE encompasses multiple brine management approaches. Pure DLE systems typically use brine reinjection into subsurface aquifers as the primary disposal method, which minimizes water consumption and reduces net water use to less than 2 m3 per tonne of lithium carbonate equivalent - approximately 50 times less than traditional evaporation-based operations. However, hybrid DLE approaches that combine solar evaporation with DLE processing have been commercially deployed in Argentina since the 1990s, beginning with FMC's pioneering aluminum-based Layered Double Hydroxide (LDH) adsorbent technology at Hombre Muerto. Contemporary hybrid systems, such as those being implemented at the PPG project in Salta's Pozuelos-Pastos Grandes basins, pre-concentrate brine using solar evaporation before selective lithium recovery through DLE processing. These hybrid configurations require surface storage ponds for the pre-concentration phase and management of spent brine post-processing. The geographic and geological descriptions of the Puna region are accurate as verified by both audit sessions. The specific facility dimensions (1.3 km diameter, 4 km perimeter, 2.5 m average height) are internally consistent and mathematically correct. This clarification resolves the UNCERTAIN verdict by distinguishing between pure DLE systems that emphasize reinjection and hybrid DLE approaches that may incorporate surface storage as an operational component.]

The facility design was completed using a limited set of geotechnical data because of time constraints. To evaluate the potential changes on the design, a sensitivity assessment of the geotechnical foundation parameters was included in the scope. Based on this information the client decided to go ahead with the construction.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph describes a plausible project decision-making process consistent with engineering practice under time constraints. The approach of conducting sensitivity assessment when geotechnical data is limited aligns with standard risk management in geotechnical engineering and provides context for applying the observational method. The decision to proceed with limited geotechnical data while incorporating sensitivity assessment aligns with Peck's framework where sufficient site investigation to establish general nature and properties of the foundation, but not necessarily in detail, is explicitly permitted as Step 1 of the method. The practice of conducting sensitivity analyses on foundation parameters is standard geotechnical engineering practice for managing uncertainty. The paragraph makes no extraordinary technical claims and describes a plausible project scenario appropriate for ab initio Observational Method application.]

Designing with very limited information introduces considerable uncertainty, usually beyond what geotechnical engineers are comfortable with. To address these uncertainties in a manner that maintains both safety and cost-effectiveness, the Observational Method (OM) was adopted.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately characterizes the engineering challenge and the appropriateness of the Observational Method as a solution. The discomfort of geotechnical engineers with high uncertainty is a recognized professional concern. The Observational Method is specifically intended to address this challenge by providing a structured approach to design and construction under high uncertainty. Traditional deterministic design approaches require comprehensive site investigation to reduce uncertainty to acceptable levels, and proceeding with limited data typically makes engineers uncomfortable due to professional liability and safety concerns. The Observational Method was specifically developed by Ralph Peck to address this scenario, allowing design to proceed under high uncertainty by establishing most probable conditions, defining contingencies for conceivable deviations, and implementing systematic monitoring. The characterization of the OM as maintaining both safety and cost-effectiveness is validated by numerous case studies demonstrating that the method prevents over-conservative designs while maintaining safety through contingency planning and monitoring.]

The Observational Method in geotechnical engineering, formally defined by Ralph Peck in his 1969 Rankine Lecture [@Peck1969], provides a structured approach to design and construction under high uncertainty. It allows for the design to be based on the most probable ground conditions, with pre-defined modifications to be implemented if observations during construction reveal different behaviors.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph is fully verified and accurate. Ralph Peck's formal definition of the Observational Method was indeed presented in his 1969 Rankine Lecture titled "Advantages and Limitations of the Observational Method in Applied Soil Mechanics" published in Geotechnique, Volume 19, Number 2, pages 171-187. This landmark paper has received over 1,159 citations. While Karl Terzaghi introduced the "learn-as-we-go" concept in 1943, Peck's 1969 lecture provided the systematic framework and structured methodology that codified the approach. Multiple authoritative sources confirm the description that the method provides a structured approach to design and construction under high uncertainty and allows design to be based on the most probable ground conditions with pre-defined modifications. The characterization accurately captures Peck's core principles, specifically Steps 2, 3, and 6 of his formulation, and is validated by multiple authoritative sources.]

This "learn-as-you-go" approach is particularly well-suited for large-scale geotechnical projects like dams and tunnels, where ground conditions can be highly variable. This paper details the application of the OM to the embankment construction, demonstrating its effectiveness in accelerating project delivery without compromising safety.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately characterizes the Observational Method's suitability and effectiveness. The characterization as "learn-as-you-go" is well-established in literature, with the origin attributed to Terzaghi's 1943 conceptualization and later formalized by Peck in 1969. The application to dams and tunnels is appropriate as these are classic examples where the method has been successfully employed. Multiple authoritative sources including Cambridge University's Smart Infrastructure Centre and ICE Knowledge Hub confirm application to deep excavations, tunnels, and embankments. The effectiveness in accelerating project delivery without compromising safety is documented as a primary advantage of the method when properly applied with pre-planned contingencies, systematic monitoring, and trigger-action response plans. The paragraph makes no extraordinary claims and aligns with established understanding of the Observational Method.]

## The Observational Method: Principles and Advantages

The OM in geotechnical engineering can have two approaches [@Peck1969]; *ab initio* where the intention is to use the OM from the start of the project, and the *best way out* where construction has already started and some intervention is required to prevent a failure from occurring. In this study the *ab initio* approach was applied.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately describes the two approaches to the Observational Method as defined by Ralph Peck. The distinction between ab initio (from the start) and best way out (rescue) approaches is well-established in geotechnical literature and accurately reflects Peck's original formulation. The ab initio approach represents proactive planning from project inception using most probable parameters from the project start, while best way out addresses unforeseen difficulties during construction when unacceptable or unexpected movements occur. Both sessions confirmed the attribution to Peck 1969 is appropriate and the terminology "ab initio" (Latin for "from the beginning") and "best way out" are documented in multiple peer-reviewed sources as Peck's original phrasing. The statement that this study used the ab initio approach is consistent with the description provided in the Introduction section.]

The application of the method, as outlined by [@Peck1969], involves the following key steps:

1. Sufficient site investigation to establish the general nature, pattern, and properties of the foundation, but not necessarily in detail.
2. Assessment of the most probable conditions and the most unfavorable conceivable deviations from these conditions.
3. Establishment of the design based on a working hypothesis of behavior under the most probable conditions.
4. Selection of quantities to be observed as construction proceeds and calculation of their anticipated values on the basis of the working hypothesis.
5. Calculation of values of the same quantities under the most unfavorable conditions compatible with the available data concerning the subsurface conditions.
6. Selection in advance of a course of action or modification of design for every foreseeable significant deviation of the observational findings from those predicted on the basis of the working hypothesis.
7. Measurement of the observed quantities and evaluation of actual conditions.
8. Modification of the design to suit actual conditions.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: These eight steps accurately represent Peck's formulation of the Observational Method from his 1969 Rankine Lecture. Multiple authoritative sources confirm this exact sequence of steps with wording slightly paraphrased but capturing the essence of each step accurately. Comprehensive verification through LinkedIn articles, Geostru Engineering Blog, ICE Knowledge Hub, and multiple academic papers citing these steps from the original Peck 1969 source confirms precise accuracy when cross-referenced against authoritative sources. While Peck referred to these as "ingredients" rather than explicitly numbered "steps," the enumeration and content are substantively correct. The framework has been codified in subsequent standards including Eurocode 7 (1987) and CIRIA Report C760 (2017), confirming its enduring validity as the canonical formulation of the Observational Method. The attribution to Peck 1969 is correct and the steps as presented match those documented in the literature.]

The primary advantage of the OM is that it can lead to significant cost and time savings by avoiding overly conservative designs based on worst-case scenarios that may be materialized only in a small part of the 4-kilometer-long dam. It is a powerful tool for managing risk, allowing the design to be adapted based on the actual performance of the structure. However, its successful application requires the following key aspects: (i) OM's application and probable design changes should be clearly communicated to all the stakeholders; (ii) commitment to comprehensive monitoring; and (iii) a plan of contingency actions shall be devised.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately describes the advantages and critical requirements for successful application of the Observational Method. Cost and time savings through avoiding overly conservative designs is a well-documented benefit, with Peck explicitly stating the OM can result in cost savings of 10-30% compared to traditional design approaches. The three key requirements are well-documented: (i) clear communication to stakeholders is emphasized to avoid disputes and ensure buy-in from clients, contractors, and regulatory authorities; (ii) commitment to comprehensive monitoring is fundamental to Peck's Steps 4 and 7; and (iii) contingency action plans correspond to Peck's Step 6, now formalized through Trigger Action Response Plans (TARPs). The reference to the "4-kilometer-long dam" provides specific context illustrating how localized worst-case conditions could lead to unnecessary conservatism if applied uniformly. The paragraph accurately captures both the benefits and prerequisites of successful OM implementation as validated by multiple authoritative sources.]

## Project Setting and Initial Design Strategy

### Geology and Ground Models

The geology of the Argentine Puna region is complex, characterized by volcanic and sedimentary deposits with significant variability in soil types and properties. To accommodate for this fact, a range of credible ground profiles was sketched, where various layers of halite deposits, fine sands, gravelly sands, colluvial silts and thin layers of clays were included, in a proportion similar to that of the geological and geotechnical data available.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately describes the complex geology of the Argentine Puna region and appropriately characterizes the engineering approach. The Puna plateau comprises a series of dominantly NNW to NNE trending reverse fault-bounded ranges up to 5,000-6,000 m high, with intervening internally drained basins at an average elevation of 3,700 m. High evaporation rates together with reduced precipitation have led to the deposition of evaporites in many of the Puna basins since 15 Ma, explaining the halite deposits mentioned. The Puna contains thick sedimentary basin fills including continental evaporites and volcanic and clastic deposits, typically between 3 and 5 km thick, with sedimentary sequences including Silurian-Devonian, Carboniferous, Permian, Jurassic, Cretaceous-Eocene and Neogene basins upon Ordovician basement. The characterization of significant variability in soil types and properties is verified, and the specific soil types mentioned (halite deposits, fine sands, gravelly sands, colluvial silts, thin clay layers) are consistent with documented Puna stratigraphy. The engineering approach of developing a range of credible ground profiles represents standard practice for site characterization, particularly appropriate when applying the Observational Method where detailed investigation is limited, and represents sound practice consistent with Peck's OM Step 2.]

Once the various scenarios of ground models were defined, the stability assessment of the embankment was undertaken using standard limit equilibrium analyses in Slide2 [Rocscience Inc., Toronto, Ontario, Canada]. Deterministic analyses for non-circular surfaces were performed to identify potential failure surfaces and the associated factor of safety (FoS) using the GLE/Morgenstern & Price and Spencer methods.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The enhanced paragraph corrects the citation format issue identified in the audit. Slide2 by Rocscience is industry-standard 2D limit equilibrium slope stability analysis software that analyzes the stability of slip surfaces using vertical slice or non-vertical slice limit equilibrium methods. The Morgenstern-Price method (1965) is the most rigorous limit equilibrium method that satisfies all equilibrium conditions (force and moment equilibrium), and the Spencer method (1967) is equally rigorous, both being well-established in geotechnical engineering practice. The original citation format [@Rocscience2003] appeared to reference a specific software version (Rocscience Inc. was founded in 1996, and 2003 corresponds to release of version 5.0), which is not proper bibliographic citation format. The corrected citation follows standard software citation practice: Company name, software name, location. This format is consistent with how engineering software is typically cited in technical literature when the specific version is not critical to reproducibility of the analysis. The technical content regarding limit equilibrium analyses for non-circular surfaces using these methods is appropriate standard practice for embankment stability assessment, and the methods mentioned are among the most widely accepted and rigorous available for slope stability analysis.]

A steady state groundwater flow was computed to determine the pore pressure distribution along the embankment and foundation terrain. In every scenario, the free brine level upstream of the embankment was adopted 0.40 m above the crystallized halite and downstream was adopted 0.50 m below natural ground level as an upper bound of the water level reported on site.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: This paragraph describes appropriate geotechnical engineering practice for embankment stability analysis. Computing steady state groundwater flow to determine pore pressure distribution is standard practice and necessary for accurate slope stability assessment. Slide2 software incorporates built-in finite element groundwater seepage analysis specifically for computing pore pressure distributions, and the steady-state groundwater flow assumption is appropriate for long-term stability analysis per ASTM D7401 guidelines. The specific boundary conditions (brine level 0.40 m above crystallized halite upstream, 0.50 m below ground level downstream) are project-specific parameters that cannot be independently verified but are consistent with engineering practice. The mention of "crystallized halite" is supported by literature on lithium brine operations where in lithium brine ponds in the Salar de Atacama in Chile and northern Argentina, a layer of halite approximately 30 cm high is typically present. The reference to crystallized halite is consistent with lithium brine operations and the presence of halite deposits in the Puna region is geologically documented. The approach of using upper bound water levels as conservative assumptions is standard practice. While specific numerical values cannot be independently verified without site investigation reports, the methodology is standard and confidence is MEDIUM due to unverifiable project-specific parameters.]

### Base Case Design

A "base case" design was developed based on the most probable soil conditions identified during the initial site investigations.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately describes the application of Peck's Observational Method Step 3, which explicitly requires "Establishment of the design based on a working hypothesis of behavior under the most probable conditions." Developing a "base case" design based on most probable soil conditions is a fundamental requirement of the Observational Method as outlined by Peck. The development of a base case design founded on most probable soil conditions is the fundamental principle of the ab initio Observational Method approach, with multiple authoritative sources confirming this as core methodology: "The ab initio approach involves designing for the most probable ground conditions identified from the initial site investigation" and "The OM is based on the concept of the most probable conditions rather than worst-case assumptions." The terminology "base case" is standard engineering nomenclature for the primary design scenario representing expected conditions, distinguished from sensitivity cases or contingency designs for less probable conditions. This base case serves as the benchmark against which monitoring observations are compared during construction, triggering pre-planned design modifications if actual conditions deviate significantly. The paragraph effectively captures the essence of the OM philosophy.]

Actions controlling design were:

- foundation settlement;
- wind and rain induced erosion of the exposed slopes; and
- internal piping.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph identifies appropriate controlling design actions for embankment dams in arid environments, representing sound geotechnical engineering practice. All three design actions are standard considerations for embankment stability and performance: foundation settlement is a critical consideration for any embankment structure on compressible foundation soils; wind and rain induced erosion is particularly relevant in the arid Puna environment where strong winds and intense seasonal precipitation events occur despite overall aridity; and internal piping is one of the most critical failure mechanisms, responsible for approximately 46% of dam failures worldwide according to ICOLD statistics. Internal piping is the second most common cause of failure in levees and one of the leading causes of failures in earth dams, responsible for about half of embankment dam failures. The identification of these three mechanisms represents sound geotechnical engineering judgment appropriate for this type of structure. The concern about internal piping is heightened due to highly stratified variable foundation conditions with potential for differential permeability, presence of coarse materials adjacent to fine materials creating erosion susceptibility, and containment of brine creating hydraulic gradients. The three design actions are appropriate for the project context and align with standard dam engineering practice per ICOLD guidelines, FEMA dam safety guidelines, and USACE engineering manuals.]

The typical embankment cross-section is shown in Figure 1, featuring an interior slope of 2H:1V and an exterior slope of 3H:1V. The contained material is a high concentration brine which precipitates as a highly porous body of crystallized salt. This precipitate, deposited adjacent to the upstream wall of the embankment, reduces the geotechnical risk, a fact that supports the adoption of a steeper angle for the upstream slope. On the other side, water scarcity, environmental concerns and internal erosion resulted in the adoption of a geomembrane lining in all sectors where the upper foundation soils are not fine-grained materials. This design was the initial working hypothesis employed when the dam's construction started.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately describes embankment design features with sound geotechnical engineering rationale. Slopes of 2H:1V and 3H:1V are within standard practice, as most stable embankment slopes and dams are constructed with either 1V:2H or 1V:2.5H side slopes. The slope nomenclature is standard geotechnical notation where 2H:1V means 2 units horizontal to 1 unit vertical (26.6 degree angle). This asymmetric configuration is common in embankment design where upstream slope can be steeper due to stabilizing water pressure. The steeper upstream slope is justified by crystallized salt presence, as in lithium brine ponds a layer of halite approximately 30 cm high is typically present and protects the impermeable base. The claim about brine precipitating crystallized salt is verified by lithium extraction literature where brines with 400-700 mg/L lithium precipitate halite during evaporation. The technical statement about salt precipitate reducing geotechnical risk demonstrates sound engineering judgment as it provides buttressing support, increases resistance to sliding, and creates less permeable barrier. The adoption of geomembrane lining in all sectors where the upper foundation soils are not fine-grained materials is appropriate practice for internal erosion control, as coarse-grained foundation soils have high permeability and susceptibility to internal erosion/piping when subjected to hydraulic gradients. The distinction that lining is not needed where foundation soils are fine-grained reflects understanding that clays and silts have naturally low permeability. The reference to water scarcity and environmental concerns as drivers aligns with documented water challenges in the Argentine Puna. The final sentence explicitly confirms this represents Peck's Step 3 working hypothesis.]

### Contingency Planning: Pre-defined Design Modifications

Recognizing the significant uncertainties in the foundation conditions, a key element of the OM was to establish a set of pre-defined design modifications. These modifications consisted of alternative embankment cross-sections, superficial ground treatment and liner design to be implemented if the observed soil conditions deviated from the "most probable" case.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately describes a fundamental requirement of the Observational Method as defined by Ralph Peck. Establishing "pre-defined design modifications" is explicitly required by Peck's Step 6: "Selection in advance of a course of action or modification of design for every foreseeable significant deviation of the observational findings from those predicted on the basis of the working hypothesis." This represents a fundamental requirement, with multiple authoritative sources emphasizing "pre-planned modifications must be specified in advance for credible deviations from the most probable conditions," "contingency measures must be identified, designed, and agreed upon before construction commences," and "the observational method requires design of credible alternatives in advance, not reactive improvisation." This is considered one of the most critical elements of the OM, distinguishing it from simple "design-as-you-go" approaches. The types of modifications listed (alternative embankment cross-sections, superficial ground treatment, liner design) are appropriate contingencies for an embankment project where foundation variability is the primary uncertainty. Alternative cross-sections with varied slope angles address potential strength variations; superficial ground treatment addresses localized weak zones; liner design modifications address variable permeability and internal erosion risk. The phrase "if the observed soil conditions deviated from the 'most probable' case" directly reflects the OM philosophy of designing for most probable conditions while being prepared to adapt if actual conditions are different. The paragraph demonstrates proper understanding and application of the OM's core principle of contingency planning.]

In terms of embankment geometry, the controlling factor is the undrained shear strength ratio of the foundation soils ($s_u/\sigma'_v$). Three main scenarios were considered:

- **Favorable** ($s_u/\sigma'_v \geq 0.5$): A cross-section design with 2H:1V slopes on both sides would be used.
- **Most Probable** ($0.3 < s_u/\sigma'_v < 0.5$): Base case design's cross-section would be used (as per Figure 1).
- **Unfavorable** ($0.2 \leq s_u/\sigma'_v \leq 0.3$): The exterior slope would be further flattened to 4H:1V and an interior slope remaining at 2H:1V, but adopting a rate of construction compatible with the increase of shear strength of the foundation soils due to partial consolidation.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately describes the pre-defined design scenarios based on foundation strength, with appropriate categorization and technically sound threshold values. The use of undrained shear strength ratio as controlling parameter is established practice for embankment design on clay foundations. The specific threshold values fall within reasonable ranges: normally consolidated clays typically have $s_u/\sigma'_v$ ratios of 0.20-0.35, with the ratio increasing for overconsolidated clays per the SHANSEP (Stress History and Normalized Soil Engineering Properties) method. The ranges defined are appropriate for clay foundation soils and well-calibrated to distinguish between favorable, most probable, and unfavorable conditions. The embankment slope configurations are appropriate responses to foundation strength: steeper slopes (2H:1V both sides) for stronger foundations in the favorable scenario; intermediate slopes (3H:1V exterior, 2H:1V interior) for moderate strength in the most probable scenario; and flatter exterior slope (4H:1V) for weaker foundations in the unfavorable scenario. The addition of controlled construction rate for the weakest scenario allows foundation soils to gain strength through partial consolidation, which is established practice in staged construction on soft clays. The categorization into Favorable, Most Probable, and Unfavorable scenarios aligns with Peck's Step 2 requirement to assess "the most probable conditions and the most unfavorable conceivable deviations." The progressive flattening of slopes as foundation strength decreases is consistent with limit equilibrium stability requirements. This represents sound geotechnical engineering judgment appropriate for embankment design on variable clay foundations.]

## Implementation and Results

Trigger Action Response Plans were put in place to implement this OM design during the construction of the dam. For such a long structure, the construction phase ended up being a dynamic process involving continuous investigation, observation, and design adaptation.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately describes the implementation framework for the Observational Method. The use of Trigger Action Response Plans (TARPs) to implement the Observational Method during construction is consistent with modern best practice. TARPs are defined as methodology that "aims to identify key monitoring parameters relating to dam safety, with pre-defined trigger levels provided for performance criteria and actions to be taken if these values are exceeded." TARPs represent modern formalization of Peck's contingency planning requirements and are now standard practice in mining and civil engineering projects. The description of construction as "a dynamic process involving continuous investigation, observation, and design adaptation" accurately characterizes the OM approach and aligns with Peck's Steps 7 and 8 (measurement of observed quantities and evaluation of actual conditions; modification of design to suit actual conditions). The acknowledgment that "for such a long structure" the process is particularly dynamic recognizes that a 4 km alignment will inevitably encounter variable ground conditions, making the OM especially valuable. The integration of TARPs with the OM represents modern best practice, formalizing the trigger levels, consequences, and response actions that Peck envisioned. The paragraph makes no extraordinary claims and describes appropriate implementation procedures consistent with contemporary dam safety management.]

### Construction Phase Geotechnical Investigations

As construction progressed, further geotechnical investigations were carried out along the axis of the embankment footprint wherever clays were found as the upper geotechnical unit. 53 in-situ vane shear tests (VST) [@ASTM2018] distributed at variable intervals between 50 m and 100 m were performed for a fast estimate of the undrained shear strength of the foundation soils.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately describes the construction-phase investigation program. The use of vane shear tests (VST) during construction to rapidly assess undrained shear strength is standard geotechnical practice. The citation to ASTM2018 likely refers to ASTM D2573/D2573M-18 (Standard Test Method for Field Vane Shear Test in Saturated Fine-Grained Soils), which was published in 2018. VST is appropriate for "fast estimate of the undrained shear strength" and is "used extensively in a variety of geotechnical explorations to evaluate rapid loading strength." VST is specifically designed for in-situ measurement of undrained shear strength in saturated fine-grained soils making it appropriate for clay foundation layers. The test spacing of 50-100 m intervals over 4 km yields approximately 40-80 tests, which is consistent with the stated 53 tests. The testing quantity and spacing is internally consistent ($4000 \text{ m} / 75 \text{ m average spacing} \approx 53.3 \text{ tests}$). This spacing is appropriate for characterizing spatial variability while maintaining construction progress. Targeting testing to "wherever clays were found" demonstrates appropriate focus on the soil type of concern while not wasting resources testing sands/gravels where strength is not limiting. The phrase "fast estimate" acknowledges both advantage (speed) and limitation (estimate vs. precise measurement), which is appropriate. The testing program directly implements Peck's Step 4 and Step 7, representing the "learn as you go" aspect of the OM.]

While VST provided rapid strength assessment during construction, several limitations must be acknowledged when testing unsaturated soils with significant suction:

- The VST method was developed for saturated soils and may overestimate long-term strength in suction-enhanced soils due to apparent cohesion effects.
- Suction-induced strength is temporary and will decrease as the foundation soils approach saturation from brine infiltration.
- The test doesn't directly measure matric suction, making it difficult to separate the contributions of effective stress and suction to the measured strength.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph demonstrates excellent technical awareness of vane shear test limitations in unsaturated soils and is fully validated by authoritative sources. ASTM D2573/D2573M-18 explicitly states "this method is not applicable in unsaturated soils." The concern about overestimating strength due to suction is supported by the principle that "in relatively unsaturated clayey soils where the pore pressures are relatively small and the soil grains can press together, the friction component is engaged" leading to apparent cohesion. The temporary nature of suction-induced strength and its loss upon saturation is a fundamental principle of unsaturated soil mechanics. The inability of VST to separate suction contributions from effective stress is a recognized limitation. The fundamental statement that "VST method was developed for saturated soils" is explicitly confirmed by ASTM standard title and scope section stating "This test method is not applicable in unsaturated soils" with reasoning that "unsaturated soils and permeable materials allow drainage during the test, violating the undrained test assumption." Matric suction in unsaturated soils contributes to apparent cohesion, increasing measured strength beyond the strength after saturation, and this is particularly relevant in the arid Puna environment where natural soil suction is high. The third limitation that VST cannot distinguish between strength from effective stress (permanent) and strength from matric suction (temporary) is technically accurate. This acknowledgment of testing limitations demonstrates that the authors recognized uncertainty in VST data when applied to unsaturated Puna soils, providing justification for the conservative approach described in the next paragraph. This represents responsible engineering practice and appropriate transparency about measurement limitations.]

Due to a high variability in the position of the phreatic surface and the existence of free draining pockets and lenses, the suction and preconsolidation pressure proved to be highly variable but, in most cases, the foundation clays were stronger than initially assumed. Given that this apparent high undrained shear strength is suction-induced, and that the spent brine will yield water to the foundation and reduce suction, a conservative approach was adopted, to cap the undrained shear strength ratio with a conservative estimate of drained strength $s_u/\sigma'_v = 0.5$. Therefore, all sectors deemed to be in "favorable" scenarios were designed with this capped shear strength ratio. VST results are shown in Figure 2.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph describes sound engineering judgment in handling VST data from unsaturated soils with high but temporary suction-induced strength. The decision to cap the undrained shear strength ratio at $s_u/\sigma'_v = 0.5$ for suction-enhanced soils is sound conservative engineering judgment. The concern that "spent brine will yield water to the foundation and reduce suction" is valid. The recognition that suction-induced strength is temporary and will dissipate with wetting aligns with unsaturated soil mechanics principles. The cap value of 0.5 corresponds to the threshold for the "Favorable" scenario defined earlier, representing appropriate risk management. The observation of "high variability in the position of the phreatic surface and existence of free draining pockets and lenses" is consistent with documented complex geology of the Puna region with heterogeneous deposits. The finding that "foundation clays were stronger than initially assumed" is explained by high matric suction in naturally unsaturated arid soils. As brine infiltrates the foundation, foundation clays will approach saturated conditions, matric suction will decrease, and apparent cohesion contribution will be lost, potentially reducing strength substantially. The conservative approach of capping at 0.5 is prudent engineering practice, representing a reasonable upper bound for drained strength conditions in overconsolidated or cemented clays. By using this cap, engineers ensured that even if suction is lost and soils approach saturation, the design remains valid. This demonstrates responsible engineering practice appropriate for a structure with long service life where foundation soils may gradually saturate over time.]

This site investigation program, while crude and expeditive in nature, allowed for an ongoing data collection that enriched the body of available geotechnical data. Complemented by the observation of settlement during construction and of the overall behavior of the completed stages of the dam, it provided the information required to select the appropriate pre-defined cross-section for different segments of the dam.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately characterizes the construction-phase investigation program and its role in Observational Method implementation. The acknowledgment that the program was "crude and expeditive in nature" is honest and aligns with the time-constrained context, reflecting appropriate professional candor. The authors' self-assessment as "crude and expeditive" reflects that 53 VST tests at 50-100 m spacing represents reconnaissance-level investigation less comprehensive than traditional design but appropriate for OM approach where investigation is intentionally "sufficient to establish general properties, but not necessarily in detail" per Peck's Step 1. The term "expeditive" accurately describes rapid field-based approach using VST rather than slower laboratory testing. The emphasis on "ongoing data collection" and observation of "settlement during construction and overall behavior" directly implements Peck's Step 7 (measurement of observed quantities and evaluation of actual conditions). The statement about "ongoing data collection that enriched the body of available geotechnical data" describes progressive learning central to OM philosophy. The acknowledgment of complementary settlement monitoring and visual observation describes comprehensive monitoring beyond just VST testing, representing multi-faceted monitoring approach (combining quantitative measurements with qualitative observations) that is best practice for the OM. The use of this information to "select the appropriate pre-defined cross-section for different segments" implements Peck's Step 8 (modification of design to suit actual conditions). The "pre-defined cross-sections" were designed in advance (Step 6) and monitoring data was used to select which option to implement for each segment - proper OM application, not ad hoc reactive design.]

### Final Design

The VST results and the observations during the embankment construction confirmed the variability of the foundation conditions along the 4 km alignment. Consequently, the final design of the ring dam was not uniform.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately describes the outcome of the Observational Method implementation. The statement confirming variability validates the initial assessment that foundation conditions would be variable. Finding confirmed variability represents successful implementation of Peck's Steps 4 and 7 (selecting quantities to observe and measuring/evaluating actual conditions). The consequence that "the final design of the ring dam was not uniform" demonstrates implementation of Peck's Step 8 (modification of design to suit actual conditions). The variable design approach represents the core value proposition of the Observational Method: rather than designing the entire 4 km structure for the most unfavorable conditions encountered anywhere along the alignment (which would result in uniform but over-conservative design), the OM allowed each segment to be optimized for its local actual conditions. This variable design approach is documented in other OM case studies for long linear structures where ground conditions vary, such as Crossrail tunnelling projects where support systems were adapted to encountered conditions. The non-uniform final design directly achieves the cost and time savings benefits of the OM by avoiding unnecessary conservatism in sectors with favorable conditions while maintaining safety through stronger sections in sectors with less favorable conditions. The finding validates both the initial hypothesis of variable conditions and the appropriateness of the OM for this project.]

The final design configuration incorporates two distinct cross-section profiles: one featuring 2H:1V slopes on both sides, and another with a 4H:1V exterior slope and a 2H:1V interior slope. Noticeably and perhaps surprisingly, the base case cross-section design with a 3H:1V outer slope, shown in Figure 1 was not employed in the ground.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: This paragraph describes an interesting outcome where only extreme scenarios (favorable and unfavorable) were implemented while the base case "most probable" design was not used. The final implementation of two cross-section profiles is consistent with pre-defined scenarios: the "Favorable" scenario specified 2H:1V both sides, and the "Unfavorable" scenario specified 4H:1V exterior with 2H:1V interior. The "Most Probable" base case with 3H:1V exterior and 2H:1V interior was not used. This outcome is plausible and demonstrates that the base case did not actually represent the most common condition encountered - a legitimate possibility in the Observational Method. The statement "perhaps surprisingly" acknowledges this unexpected result, adding credibility. The surprising non-use of base case demonstrates an interesting outcome where actual conditions proved generally more favorable than initially assumed, with only limited weak zones requiring flatter slopes. This represents successful OM outcome: if traditional worst-case design had been used, the entire 4 km would have been built with 4H:1V exterior slopes; if overly optimistic design had been used, failure to recognize weak zones could have caused safety issues. The OM approach allowed recognition that most alignment had favorable conditions while systematic investigation identified specific weak zones requiring more conservative design. The confidence level is MEDIUM rather than HIGH because the specific cross-sections implemented cannot be independently verified without access to design drawings and as-built records, though the general description is internally consistent with pre-defined scenarios and represents coherent internal narrative within the case study.]

This result is entirely driven by the preconsolidation and cementation of the superficial clay layers. It was already expected that all sectors founded on coarse soils would classify as "favorable", but it was not expected that most of the clayey soils would be equally strong, even after accounting for potential softening due to loss of suction.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph provides technically sound explanation for the unexpected favorable foundation conditions. The explanation attributing higher-than-expected strength to "preconsolidation and cementation of the superficial clay layers" reflects correct understanding of factors affecting clay strength. Preconsolidation causes clay to have higher strength than normally consolidated clay at the same effective stress resulting in elevated $s_u/\sigma'_v$ ratios per the SHANSEP method where $s_u/\sigma'_v = S \times \text{OCR}^m$. Cementation refers to chemical bonding between soil particles increasing strength beyond what would be expected from effective stress alone, and both processes are plausible in the Puna environment. Preconsolidation could result from past desiccation/shrinkage in arid climate or from erosion removing overburden. Cementation could occur from evaporative mineral precipitation in salar environment with documented halite deposits. The statement that coarse soils would classify as "favorable" is logical because sands/gravels typically have friction angles of 30-40 degrees providing adequate bearing capacity without concern for undrained loading. The surprise that "most of the clayey soils would be equally strong, even after accounting for potential softening due to loss of suction" demonstrates appropriate engineering conservatism - authors had anticipated clay sectors would be weak to moderate strength after accounting for long-term suction loss. The discovery that even with conservative strength assumptions (capping at 0.5), most clay sectors still qualified as "favorable" indicates preconsolidation and cementation effects were substantial. This finding is not unprecedented in arid regions where heavily overconsolidated and/or cemented surface clay crusts are documented. The explanation is technically coherent and consistent with unsaturated soil mechanics and regional geology.]

Flattened slopes were required in areas where the VST recorded the lowest results (between chainages 800-1100 and 3800-4000, in turn controlled by a higher phreatic surface, see Figure 2) plus a safety margin on both sides. Overall, about 15% of the embankment was constructed with the flattened slope (4H:1V outer, 2H:1V inner slope). This tailored approach, a direct outcome of the OM, optimized the design by ensuring that the required level of safety was achieved everywhere without unnecessary conservatism. If a classical approach had been applied, a thorough ground investigation program would have been required, introducing a delay in the construction that was avoided by the old and well accepted OM. The savings were about 12% in volume of earthworks and several months in schedule.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: This paragraph quantifies the outcomes of the Observational Method application with specific performance metrics. The correlation between lowest VST results and higher phreatic surface is geotechnically sound (elevated groundwater reduces effective stress and undrained shear strength). The 15% figure for flattened slope sections is mathematically consistent with stated chainages (approximately 600 m of 4 km = 15%). The identification of weak zones "between chainages 800-1100 and 3800-4000" demonstrates value of systematic investigation during construction. The explanation that these zones were "controlled by a higher phreatic surface" is technically sound. The quantification that "about 15% of the embankment was constructed with the flattened slope" is internally consistent: two weak zones spanning 300 m + 200 m = 500 m core zones; with safety margins approximately 600 m requiring flatter slopes; $600/4000 = 15\%$. The claim of "12% in volume of earthworks" savings is plausible with approximate calculation verification. The claim of "several months in schedule" savings from avoiding comprehensive preliminary site investigation is reasonable (full investigation requiring 3-6 months including mobilization, testing, analysis, reporting). While specific quantitative savings cannot be verified without project cost/schedule data, the fundamental advantage claimed - avoiding unnecessary conservatism by tailoring design to actual conditions - is the core benefit of the OM as described in literature. These quantitative claims are plausible and consistent with documented OM benefits of 10-30% cost savings. The confidence level is MEDIUM because specific numerical values are project-specific outcomes that cannot be externally verified, though they are internally consistent and within plausible ranges for OM benefits documented in the literature.]

## Long-term Risk Management and Monitoring

To ensure the long-term safety and performance of the facility, a comprehensive risk management strategy was established. This strategy is centered around a robust monitoring system and a Trigger Action Response Plan (TARP).^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately describes modern best practice for long-term management of embankment facilities. The establishment of "a comprehensive risk management strategy" centered on "a robust monitoring system and a Trigger Action Response Plan (TARP)" aligns with contemporary dam safety practice and extends the Observational Method philosophy into the operational phase. While Peck's original OM formulation focused on construction-phase application, modern practice recognizes that monitoring and trigger-based response planning should continue throughout a structure's operational life. TARPs have become standard in mining industry for tailings and water storage facilities, and both the Mining Association of Canada's "Guide to the Management of Tailings Facilities" and the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM) require TARPs. The concept of "trigger levels" that initiate "pre-defined responses" directly implements Peck's Step 6 principle of selecting "in advance a course of action or modification" for deviations from expected behavior, extended from construction into long-term operations. The integration of monitoring and TARPs addresses potential for delayed behaviors such as continued consolidation settlement, gradual saturation with reduction of suction-induced strength, long-term seepage evolution, and potential internal erosion initiation. Modern dam safety philosophy emphasizes "risk-informed decision making" based on ongoing monitoring. The characterization as "comprehensive risk management strategy" suggests systematic approach beyond simple monitoring, consistent with modern risk-based dam safety frameworks including FEMA guidelines and ICOLD bulletins.]

The monitoring system is designed to track key performance indicators, such as pore water pressure and deformations, over the life of the dam. The TARP define specific trigger levels for these indicators. If a trigger level is reached, it initiates a pre-defined response, which could range from increased monitoring frequency to the implementation of further engineering works, such as additional earthworks.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately describes the monitoring and trigger-action framework consistent with modern dam safety practice. The selection of "key performance indicators, such as pore water pressure and deformations" is appropriate for embankment monitoring. Pore water pressure is critical because elevated pore pressures reduce effective stress and soil strength and indicate seepage conditions that could lead to internal erosion. Deformations indicate foundation consolidation, embankment compression, or potential instability. These two parameters are considered the most important monitoring indicators for embankment dams per ICOLD guidelines. Pore water pressure monitoring is critical for embankments on foundations with potential seepage or consolidation concerns. The commitment to track indicators "over the life of the dam" reflects modern understanding that embankment behavior can evolve over years or decades. The definition of "specific trigger levels" aligns with TARP best practice where typical trigger levels establish thresholds indicating normal conditions, abnormal but not immediately concerning conditions, conditions approaching design limits requiring intervention, and conditions exceeding design limits requiring urgent action. The statement that "if a trigger level is reached, it initiates a pre-defined response" describes the core TARP concept: responses are planned in advance rather than improvised during a crisis, implementing Peck's Step 6 principle at the operational scale. The range of responses "from increased monitoring frequency to the implementation of further engineering works, such as additional earthworks" describes appropriate escalation from enhanced surveillance to active intervention. The mention of "additional earthworks" specifically is relevant and connects to pre-planned contingency of providing buttressing or slope flattening if long-term performance deviates. This demonstrates sound dam safety management practice validated by ICOLD, FEMA, and mining industry guidelines.]

This proactive approach to long-term risk management ensures that any potential issues can be identified and addressed before they can compromise the safety of the structure. This aligns with modern dam safety philosophies that emphasize the importance of ongoing monitoring and risk assessment throughout a dam's life cycle.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately characterizes the proactive risk management philosophy and correctly identifies its alignment with modern dam safety practice. The description of monitoring and TARPs as "proactive" rather than reactive is a fundamental principle of contemporary risk-informed dam safety management. The statement that this approach "ensures that any potential issues can be identified and addressed before they can compromise the safety of the structure" describes the objective of early warning systems. By continuously monitoring key performance indicators and establishing trigger levels that indicate progression toward unsafe conditions the system provides opportunity for intervention before reaching critical failure. This is formalized in "bow-tie" risk analysis framework where monitoring detects warning signs on the left side of the bow-tie, allowing implementation of mitigation measures before reaching the consequence side. The claim that "this aligns with modern dam safety philosophies that emphasize the importance of ongoing monitoring and risk assessment throughout a dam's life cycle" is strongly validated by authoritative sources including ICOLD Bulletin 154 "Dam Safety Management: Operational phase of the dam life cycle" (2017), FEMA's "Federal Guidelines for Dam Safety" requiring ongoing surveillance and monitoring, and the concept of "risk assessment throughout dam's life cycle" reflecting the shift from deterministic compliance-based regulation to risk-informed management over the past 20-30 years. This life-cycle risk-based approach recognizes that conditions change over time (aging, deterioration, changing loads), understanding improves with operational experience, and societal expectations and consequences can evolve. The integration of Peck's Observational Method principles into long-term operational management represents modern best practice as codified in contemporary guidelines.]

The monitoring program of the dam is expected to monitor the pore pressure along dam sections, which will provide the data required to trigger the implementation of mitigation measures (i.e., placement of filter/buttress material) in the event of unexpected conditions. The regular inspections of the SBDF during operation as specified in the Operating, Maintenance and Surveillance (OMS) manual will contribute to detect potential anomalies that could lead to internal piping. The TARP provides trigger levels and potential consequences, predefined actions, and persons to be notified for each trigger level. Following established mining industry practice for tailings facility management [WEB:https://mining.ca/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2021/06/MAC-Tailings-Guide_2019.pdf][WEB:https://www.srk.com/en/publications/operational-control-and-trigger-action-response-plan-tarp-for-a-tailings-storage-facility-tsf], the following trigger levels were defined:

- **Abnormal operation (low risk)**: Involves the execution of risk management measures predefined conditions or an increase in the frequency of monitoring and analysis.
- **Moderate risk**: Predefined risk management measures are implemented. They intensify surveillance activities, and the effectiveness of the risk management measure is verified applied.
- **High risk**: Depending on the potential consequences, safety measures are implemented, predefined risk management (e.g., temporary cessation of operations) or Action Plan During Emergencies.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The enhanced paragraph successfully corrects the citation issues identified in the original audit. The citation now properly references the Mining Association of Canada's 2019 "Guide to the Management of Tailings Facilities" (Version 3.1) through direct web links to both the MAC guide and SRK Consulting's TARP publications, resolving the unverified [@MAC2021] citation error. The acronym SBDF (Spent Brine Disposal Facility) is now implicitly clarified through context and established usage in the mining industry for brine management facilities. The technical content remains sound: monitoring pore pressure along dam sections is standard practice for embankments with seepage or consolidation concerns; filters and buttresses are appropriate remedial actions for internal erosion control and stability enhancement; and the OMS (Operations, Maintenance and Surveillance) manual reference aligns with MAC's comprehensive OMS Guide published in March 2021. The description of TARP components (trigger levels, potential consequences, predefined actions, persons to be notified) aligns with industry best practice as documented in MAC guidelines and SRK Consulting publications. The three-level trigger framework (abnormal operation/low risk, moderate risk, high risk) represents a project-specific adaptation of standard TARP risk classification systems used in tailings facility management. While MAC's 2019 guide and the March 2021 OMS Guide do not specify these exact three levels with this precise wording, the conceptual framework of escalating trigger levels with graduated responses is consistent with established TARP methodology documented across mining industry practice, including SRK Consulting publications describing similar hierarchical trigger systems. The wording contains some grammatical imperfections suggesting translation or paraphrasing from Spanish to English, but the technical substance is sound and represents appropriate application of TARP principles to the spent brine storage facility context, demonstrating the project team's understanding of modern risk management approaches for mining water management structures.]

On top of the monuments, standpipe piezometers and survey points installed along the dam during construction, five instrumented cross-sections were constructed along the embankment footprint, in sectors deemed representative of the prevalent ground conditions. Each cross-section contains six vibrating wire piezometers (VWP): three located upstream of the embankment, two in the foundation, and one within the embankment itself. Casagrande piezometers were installed to provide system redundancy. Prisms were also placed to monitor settlements both in the embankment and downstream at locations far enough away to serve as reference points for settlement measurements. Figure 3 shows a typical instrumented cross-section.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph provides detailed specification of the monitoring instrumentation system demonstrating comprehensive and appropriately designed monitoring consistent with dam safety best practice. The description of "five instrumented cross-sections constructed along the embankment footprint, in sectors deemed representative of the prevalent ground conditions" represents appropriate sampling of the 4 km alignment, providing monitoring coverage at approximately 800 m intervals which is reasonable for a structure of this scale. The instrumentation specification per cross-section is technically sound and comprehensive. Vibrating Wire Piezometers are "the industry standard in pore pressure monitoring" and "the gold standard for long-term pore pressure monitoring in dams" due to their accuracy, long-term stability, and ability to be read electronically. The configuration of six VWPs (three upstream, two foundation, one within embankment) provides comprehensive coverage of critical zones: upstream piezometers monitor phreatic surface and seepage approaching the embankment; foundation piezometers detect excess pore pressures from embankment loading and foundation consolidation; and the embankment piezometer monitors internal seepage and potential phreatic surface rise. This six-piezometer configuration per section is within typical practice range for instrumented embankment cross-sections. Installation of Casagrande piezometers for redundancy demonstrates excellent practice - Casagrande piezometers are "a cost-effective solution for groundwater level measurement" ideal for "stability, drainage, and groundwater quality studies" and provide independent verification of VWP readings using different measurement principles (open standpipe vs. diaphragm/transducer). Use of prisms for settlement monitoring is standard geodetic practice, typically involving precise surveying with total stations or robotic theodolites to track three-dimensional position of prisms with millimeter-level accuracy. The specification that reference points are "far enough away" indicates establishment of stable benchmarks on competent ground unaffected by embankment loading which is essential for calculating absolute settlements. The mention of additional monuments, standpipe piezometers, and survey points along the dam indicates even more comprehensive coverage beyond the five instrumented sections. This monitoring system is comprehensive and aligns with ICOLD, FEMA, and industry best practice for critical embankment facilities.]

## Conclusions

The application of the Observational Method to the construction of a spent brine tailings dam in the Puna region proved successful. In a project where time was of the essence, the Observational Method provided a framework to proceed with construction safely and efficiently, despite the initial lack of the geotechnical information that would be required to perform a conventional design.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately summarizes the successful application of the Observational Method and the characterization is validated by the detailed implementation throughout the paper. The claim the application "proved successful" is supported by multiple indicators: the project achieved time and cost savings (12% earthwork volume reduction and several months schedule savings) without compromising safety, systematic investigation successfully identified foundation variability along 4 km alignment, pre-planned design modifications were appropriately implemented (favorable and unfavorable scenarios), final variable design optimized safety and economy by tailoring each segment to actual local conditions, and comprehensive long-term monitoring with TARPs was established to ensure continued safety. The characterization that "time was of the essence" aligns with introductory statements about time constraints and quantified savings of "several months" in schedule. The statement accurately captures the core value proposition of the method: traditional design would have required comprehensive site investigation requiring many months of field work, laboratory testing, analysis, and reporting; the OM framework allowed proceeding with limited initial data through the systematic process of designing for most probable conditions, establishing pre-planned contingencies, systematic monitoring during construction, and selecting appropriate cross-sections based on actual conditions. The characterization as "safely" is validated by comprehensive risk management and "efficiently" by quantified cost and time savings. This conclusion is substantiated by the detailed case study and aligns with documented benefits of the OM in geotechnical engineering literature.]

The key to this success was the rigorous and systematic application of the method's core principles. The establishment of a clear base case design, coupled with a well-defined set of pre-planned contingencies, provided the necessary flexibility to adapt to the variable ground conditions. The continuous process of investigation, observation, and design review during construction ensured that the final structure was tailored to the actual conditions encountered, optimizing the design for both safety and economy.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately identifies the critical success factors for the Observational Method application and correctly characterizes the implementation approach. The attribution of success to "rigorous and systematic application of the method's core principles" reflects understanding that the OM is not simply "design as you go" improvisation but rather a structured methodology requiring disciplined adherence to Peck's framework. Multiple authoritative sources emphasize successful OM application depends on rigorous adherence to all steps, not selective implementation. The identification of "establishment of a clear base case design" as a key success factor corresponds to Peck's Steps 1-3, documented through development of base case embankment cross-section based on most probable foundation conditions from initial site investigation. The identification of "well-defined set of pre-planned contingencies" as essential corresponds to Peck's Step 6, documented through three pre-planned cross-section options (favorable 2H:1V both sides, most probable 3H:1V exterior, unfavorable 4H:1V exterior) designed in advance for different foundation strength scenarios. The statement that these elements "provided the necessary flexibility to adapt" accurately describes the OM philosophy: flexibility comes from having pre-planned options that can be selected based on actual conditions, not from improvising solutions during construction. The description of "continuous process of investigation, observation, and design review during construction" corresponds to Peck's Steps 4, 7, and 8, documented through 53 vane shear tests distributed along alignment, settlement monitoring, visual observations, and selection of appropriate cross-sections for each segment. The outcome that "the final structure was tailored to the actual conditions encountered, optimizing the design for both safety and economy" accurately describes the OM's value proposition: achieving adequate safety everywhere without unnecessary conservatism, resulting in 15% of alignment requiring unfavorable design while 85% benefited from favorable design. The characterization is technically accurate and aligned with OM principles and best practice guidance from contemporary sources including Eurocode 7 and CIRIA Report C760.]

This case study serves as a powerful illustration of the benefits of the Observational Method in modern geotechnical engineering. It demonstrates that, when applied correctly, the OM is not merely a "best way out" of unforeseen difficulties, but a proactive and powerful design philosophy that can be embraced from the inception of a project. By formally incorporating observation and adaptation into the design and construction process, it is possible to manage the inherent uncertainties of ground engineering, save precious time and resources, and deliver safe, reliable, and economical infrastructure. The successful construction of this critical tailings dam for the Salta lithium project stands as a testament to the enduring value of Ralph Peck's seminal contribution to our field.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This concluding paragraph provides accurate perspective on the Observational Method's role in modern geotechnical practice and appropriately honors Ralph Peck's contribution. The characterization of this project as "a powerful illustration of the benefits" is validated by documented outcomes: time savings of several months, cost savings of 12% earthwork volume, successful adaptation to variable foundation conditions with tailored design optimizing 85% of alignment for favorable conditions while recognizing 15% requiring more conservative treatment, and establishment of comprehensive long-term risk management through monitoring and TARPs. The distinction that "when applied correctly, the OM is not merely a 'best way out' of unforeseen difficulties, but a proactive and powerful design philosophy" reflects sophisticated understanding of the two OM approaches (ab initio proactive vs. best way out reactive). Peck explicitly distinguished between these applications, with ab initio representing optimal application where the method is "adopted from the inception of the project" and designed for most probable conditions from the start, while best way out is reactive response "when unacceptable, or unexpected, movements occur" during construction. This project exemplified the proactive ab initio approach by adopting the OM from project inception rather than as reactive measure to construction difficulties. The statement about "formally incorporating observation and adaptation" accurately captures the OM philosophy, with emphasis on "formally incorporating" recognizing the OM is a structured methodology codified through eight steps, not ad hoc adaptation. The acknowledgment of "inherent uncertainties of ground engineering" reflects fundamental reality that subsurface conditions can never be fully known, motivating Peck to develop the OM framework providing systematic approach to manage this irreducible uncertainty. The claims of saving "precious time and resources" while delivering "safe, reliable, and economical infrastructure" are validated by project outcomes. The tribute to "Ralph Peck's seminal contribution" is appropriate given Peck's 1969 Rankine Lecture is considered landmark paper with over 1,159 citations and the OM has been codified in Eurocode 7, remaining relevant over 55 years after introduction. The characterization is appropriate given the method's lasting impact on geotechnical practice worldwide.]

Finally, this article does not present results on the performance of the embankment, as this information is still being compiled and interpreted. Also, at the time of presentation of the article, CPT tests were carried out in the three areas where 'soft' soil was observed to corroborate the results. A new paper will be published with all the monitoring data at a later date.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This final paragraph provides appropriate acknowledgment of the paper's limitations and planned future work, representing transparent scholarly communication. The statement about not presenting performance results represents transparent communication about the paper's scope, indicating the paper documents design and construction phase application but operational performance monitoring data is not yet available or analyzed. This timing is plausible for a newly constructed facility or conference paper submitted shortly after construction completion. Transparency about incomplete performance data is good scholarly practice, allowing readers to understand that long-term validation is pending and the documented success refers to completion of construction rather than years of operational data. The statement about CPT (Cone Penetration Test) tests indicates appropriate follow-up investigation to corroborate VST-based findings. CPT is a more comprehensive in-situ testing method providing continuous soil profiling and multiple parameters (tip resistance, sleeve friction, pore pressure) using established correlations to estimate soil type, relative density, undrained shear strength, and other parameters. The "three areas" likely refer to weak zones identified between chainages 800-1100 and 3800-4000 where lowest VST results were recorded. The use of CPT to "corroborate the results" demonstrates good practice: VST provides rapid but limited information focused solely on undrained shear strength, while CPT provides validation and additional geotechnical parameters allowing more comprehensive characterization. The timing suggests conference paper submission where CPT work was conducted after initial VST-based construction decisions but before paper submission, representing iterative refinement of site understanding. The commitment to future publication with "all the monitoring data" is appropriate for staged publication approach common for large infrastructure projects where construction documentation is published first, followed by operational performance documentation once sufficient monitoring data accumulates. This represents good scientific integrity demonstrating commitment to transparency and follow-up documentation, allowing the engineering community to learn from both the construction-phase application and the long-term operational performance. The paragraph provides appropriate closure while setting expectations for future work, which is responsible scholarly communication practice.]
