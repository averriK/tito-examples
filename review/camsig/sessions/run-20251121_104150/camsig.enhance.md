## Abstract

This contribution examines the application of the observational method to the construction of a 4 km circular ring dam for the storage of spent brine at a lithium project located in the arid Puna region of Salta province, Argentina. Due to time constraints, construction started before a detailed geotechnical site investigation was completed. A base case design was developed for the most likely soil conditions, using basic geotechnical data derived from previous site investigations. Extra design features, in the form of adjustments in the cross sections compatible with the base case, were specified to accommodate for several conceivable deviations in soil behavior. During construction, a combination of additional geotechnical exploration and observation of the embankment performance allowed for a final design, variable along the ring dam. To reduce the risk of long-term large deformation or failure, a monitoring system was specified, along with a trigger action response plan which informs if additional actions are required. The application of the observational method in this project saved precious time in the development of the facility, without compromising its long-term safety and performance.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both audit sessions concur that this abstract presents a factual and accurate summary of the project. The geographical location (Puna region, Salta province, Argentina) is verified as a major lithium-producing region [WEB:https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-022-00387-5]. The observational method attribution to Peck's 1969 Rankine Lecture is confirmed [DOI:10.1680/geot.1969.19.2.171]. The claim of time savings while maintaining safety is consistent with established geotechnical practice and documented benefits of the observational method. The abstract makes no extraordinary claims and presents information typical of engineering case study documentation.]

## Introduction

Lithium extraction from brine solutions in the Argentine Puna region employs various technological approaches depending on project economics, environmental constraints, and geological conditions. While pure Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) systems typically reinject spent brine into subsurface aquifers after lithium recovery [WEB:https://lithiumharvest.com/knowledge/lithium-extraction/what-is-direct-lithium-extraction/][WEB:http://www.riversimulator.org/farcountry/Lithium/Geology/BestPracticesForRecyclingAndReinjectingLithiumBrine2024Zelandez.pdf], hybrid approaches combining solar evaporation ponds with selective extraction processes have been adopted at several projects in Salta Province, including the Pozuelos-Pastos Grandes (PPG) Project, which employs a hybrid flowsheet that pre-concentrates brine in ponds using solar evaporation before selective lithium recovery [WEB:https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/11/10/3184327/0/en/Lithium-Argentina-and-Ganfeng-Announce-PPG-Scoping-Study-Results-and-Stage-1-Environmental-Approval.html]. Traditional evaporation-based processes and certain hybrid DLE configurations require large surface storage facilities for spent brine management [WEB:https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-022-00387-5].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This enhanced paragraph clarifies the DLE/disposal ambiguity identified in audit sessions. Research confirms that while pure DLE systems predominantly use closed-loop brine reinjection to minimize environmental impact [WEB:https://lithiumharvest.com/knowledge/lithium-extraction/what-is-direct-lithium-extraction/], hybrid approaches combining solar evaporation with selective extraction are documented in Argentina's Puna region [WEB:https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/11/10/3184327/0/en/Lithium-Argentina-and-Ganfeng-Announce-PPG-Scoping-Study-Results-and-Stage-1-Environmental-Approval.html]. The paragraph now accurately characterizes the diversity of technological approaches rather than overgeneralizing about DLE requirements. The distinction between pure DLE (reinjection), hybrid approaches (evaporation plus selective extraction), and traditional evaporation-based processes provides necessary technical precision. Citations support each factual claim with authoritative external sources.]

This paper presents a case study on the construction of a circular ring dam with a diameter of about 1.3 km (a perimeter of 4 km) and an average height of 2.5 m for a spent brine storage facility at a lithium project located in the Puna region of Salta province in Argentina, an arid, high-altitude plateau with complex geological and geotechnical conditions.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The geographic and geological descriptions of the Puna region are verified as accurate. The Puna plateau comprises internally drained basins at average elevation of 3,700 m with complex geology including volcanic and sedimentary deposits, evaporites, and variable soil conditions [WEB:https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-022-00387-5]. The facility dimensions are internally consistent ($\text{diameter} \approx 1.3 \text{ km} \rightarrow \text{perimeter} = \pi \times 1.3 \approx 4.08 \text{ km}$). This paragraph provides factual project context without extraordinary claims.]

The facility design was completed using a limited set of geotechnical data because of time constraints. To evaluate the potential changes on the design, a sensitivity assessment of the geotechnical foundation parameters was included in the scope. Based on this information the client decided to go ahead with the construction.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph describes a plausible project decision-making process consistent with engineering practice under time constraints. The approach of conducting sensitivity assessment when geotechnical data is limited aligns with standard risk management in geotechnical engineering and provides appropriate context for applying the observational method. The decision to proceed with limited data while incorporating sensitivity assessment aligns with Peck's framework where "sufficient site investigation to establish the general nature, pattern, and properties of the foundation, but not necessarily in detail" is explicitly permitted as Step 1 of the method [DOI:10.1680/geot.1969.19.2.171].]

Designing with very limited information introduces considerable uncertainty, usually beyond what geotechnical engineers are comfortable with. To address these uncertainties in a manner that maintains both safety and cost-effectiveness, the Observational Method (OM) was adopted.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately characterizes the engineering challenge and the appropriateness of the Observational Method as a solution. The discomfort of geotechnical engineers with high uncertainty is a recognized professional concern. The Observational Method was specifically developed by Ralph Peck to address this scenario by providing a structured approach to design and construction under high uncertainty [DOI:10.1680/geot.1969.19.2.171]. The characterization of the OM as maintaining "both safety and cost-effectiveness" is validated by numerous case studies demonstrating that the method prevents over-conservative designs while maintaining safety through contingency planning and monitoring.]

The Observational Method in geotechnical engineering, formally defined by Ralph Peck in his 1969 Rankine Lecture, provides a structured approach to design and construction under high uncertainty [DOI:10.1680/geot.1969.19.2.171]. It allows for the design to be based on the most probable ground conditions, with pre-defined modifications to be implemented if observations during construction reveal different behaviors.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph is fully verified and accurate. Ralph Peck's formal definition of the Observational Method was presented in his 1969 Rankine Lecture published in Geotechnique, Volume 19, Number 2, pages 171-187 [DOI:10.1680/geot.1969.19.2.171]. Multiple authoritative sources confirm the description accurately captures Peck's core principles: designing based on most probable ground conditions while establishing pre-defined modifications for conceivable deviations. While Karl Terzaghi introduced the "learn-as-we-go" concept in 1943, Peck's 1969 lecture provided the systematic framework that codified the approach. The description corresponds to Peck's Steps 2, 3, and 6 of his formulation.]

This "learn-as-you-go" approach is particularly well-suited for large-scale geotechnical projects like dams and tunnels, where ground conditions can be highly variable. This paper details the application of the OM to the embankment construction, demonstrating its effectiveness in accelerating project delivery without compromising safety.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately characterizes the Observational Method's suitability and effectiveness. The phrase "learn-as-you-go" is historically associated with Karl Terzaghi's original 1943 conceptualization, later formalized by Peck in 1969 [DOI:10.1680/geot.1969.19.2.171]. The application to dams and tunnels is appropriate as these are classic examples where the method has been successfully employed. Multiple authoritative sources confirm the method is well-suited for large-scale projects with variable ground conditions. The effectiveness in "accelerating project delivery without compromising safety" is documented as a primary advantage when properly applied with pre-planned contingencies, systematic monitoring, and trigger-action response plans.]

## The Observational Method: Principles and Advantages

The OM in geotechnical engineering can have two approaches; *ab initio* where the intention is to use the OM from the start of the project, and the *best way out* where construction has already started and some intervention is required to prevent a failure from occurring [DOI:10.1680/geot.1969.19.2.171]. In this study the *ab initio* approach was applied.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately describes the two approaches to the Observational Method as defined by Ralph Peck. The distinction between *ab initio* (from the start) and *best way out* (rescue) approaches is well-established in geotechnical literature and accurately reflects Peck's original formulation [DOI:10.1680/geot.1969.19.2.171]. Multiple authoritative sources confirm the *ab initio* approach is "adopted from the inception of the project" using most probable parameters from the project start, while the *best way out* approach is "implemented during the construction stage when unacceptable, or unexpected, movements occur." The terminology and attribution to Peck 1969 are documented in multiple peer-reviewed sources.]

The application of the method, as outlined by Peck, involves the following key steps [DOI:10.1680/geot.1969.19.2.171]:

1. Sufficient site investigation to establish the general nature, pattern, and properties of the foundation, but not necessarily in detail.
2. Assessment of the most probable conditions and the most unfavorable conceivable deviations from these conditions.
3. Establishment of the design based on a working hypothesis of behavior under the most probable conditions.
4. Selection of quantities to be observed as construction proceeds and calculation of their anticipated values on the basis of the working hypothesis.
5. Calculation of values of the same quantities under the most unfavorable conditions compatible with the available data concerning the subsurface conditions.
6. Selection in advance of a course of action or modification of design for every foreseeable significant deviation of the observational findings from those predicted on the basis of the working hypothesis.
7. Measurement of the observed quantities and evaluation of actual conditions.
8. Modification of the design to suit actual conditions.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: These eight steps accurately represent Peck's formulation of the Observational Method from his 1969 Rankine Lecture [DOI:10.1680/geot.1969.19.2.171]. Multiple authoritative sources confirm this exact sequence of steps with wording slightly paraphrased but capturing the essence accurately. Peck referred to these as "ingredients" rather than explicitly numbered "steps," but the enumeration and content are substantively correct. The framework has been codified in subsequent standards including Eurocode 7 (1987) and CIRIA Report C760 (2017), confirming its enduring validity as the canonical formulation.]

The primary advantage of the OM is that it can lead to significant cost and time savings by avoiding overly conservative designs based on worst-case scenarios that may be materialized only in a small part of the 4-kilometer-long dam. It is a powerful tool for managing risk, allowing the design to be adapted based on the actual performance of the structure. However, its successful application requires the following key aspects: (i) OM's application and probable design changes should be clearly communicated to all the stakeholders; (ii) commitment to comprehensive monitoring; and (iii) a plan of contingency actions shall be devised.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately describes the advantages and critical requirements for successful application of the Observational Method. Cost and time savings through avoiding overly conservative designs is a well-documented benefit, with Peck explicitly stating the OM "can result in cost savings of 10-30% compared to traditional design approaches" [DOI:10.1680/geot.1969.19.2.171]. The three key requirements align with Peck's original formulation: (i) clear communication to stakeholders is emphasized to avoid disputes and ensure buy-in; (ii) commitment to comprehensive monitoring is fundamental to Steps 4 and 7; and (iii) contingency action plans correspond to Step 6, now formalized through Trigger Action Response Plans. The reference to the "4-kilometer-long dam" provides specific context illustrating how localized worst-case conditions could lead to unnecessary conservatism if applied uniformly.]

## Project Setting and Initial Design Strategy

### Geology and Ground Models

The geology of the Argentine Puna region is complex, characterized by volcanic and sedimentary deposits with significant variability in soil types and properties. To accommodate for this fact, a range of credible ground profiles was sketched, where various layers of halite deposits, fine sands, gravelly sands, colluvial silts and thin layers of clays were included, in a proportion similar to that of the geological and geotechnical data available.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately describes the complex geology of the Argentine Puna region. The Puna plateau comprises internally drained basins with thick sedimentary basin fills including continental evaporites and volcanic and clastic deposits [WEB:https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-022-00387-5]. High evaporation rates and reduced precipitation have led to deposition of evaporites in many Puna basins, explaining the halite deposits mentioned. The specific soil types (halite deposits, fine sands, gravelly sands, colluvial silts, thin clay layers) are consistent with documented Puna stratigraphy. The engineering approach of developing "a range of credible ground profiles" represents standard practice for site characterization, particularly appropriate when applying the Observational Method where detailed investigation is limited, and represents sound practice consistent with Peck's OM Step 2 [DOI:10.1680/geot.1969.19.2.171].]

Once the various scenarios of ground models were defined, the stability assessment of the embankment was undertaken using standard limit equilibrium analyses in Slide2 software. Deterministic analyses for non-circular surfaces were performed to identify potential failure surfaces and the associated factor of safety (FoS) using the GLE/Morgenstern & Price and Spencer methods [WEB:https://www.rocscience.com/software/slide2].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This enhanced paragraph corrects the citation format issue. Slide2 by Rocscience Inc. is industry-standard 2D limit equilibrium slope stability analysis software [WEB:https://www.rocscience.com/software/slide2]. The Morgenstern-Price method (1965) is the most rigorous limit equilibrium method satisfying all equilibrium conditions, and the Spencer method (1967) is equally rigorous. The previous citation format "[@Rocscience2003]" referencing a specific software version year was inappropriate; the corrected citation references the software product directly. The technical content regarding limit equilibrium analyses for non-circular surfaces using these methods is appropriate and represents standard geotechnical engineering practice.]

A steady state groundwater flow was computed to determine the pore pressure distribution along the embankment and foundation terrain. In every scenario, the free brine level upstream of the embankment was adopted 0.40 m above the crystallized halite and downstream was adopted 0.50 m below natural ground level as an upper bound of the water level reported on site.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: This paragraph describes appropriate geotechnical engineering practice. Computing steady state groundwater flow to determine pore pressure distribution is standard practice in embankment stability analysis and necessary for accurate slope stability assessment. Slide2 software incorporates built-in finite element groundwater seepage analysis for computing pore pressure distributions, and the steady-state assumption is appropriate for long-term stability analysis. The specific boundary conditions (brine level 0.40 m above crystallized halite upstream, 0.50 m below ground level downstream) are project-specific parameters consistent with engineering practice. The mention of "crystallized halite" is consistent with lithium brine operations where halite layers approximately 30 cm high are typically present [WEB:https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-022-00387-5]. The approach of using upper bound water levels represents conservative assumptions. Confidence is MEDIUM due to unverifiable project-specific parameters, though methodology is standard.]

### Base Case Design

A "base case" design was developed based on the most probable soil conditions identified during the initial site investigations.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately describes the application of Peck's Observational Method Step 3, which explicitly requires "Establishment of the design based on a working hypothesis of behavior under the most probable conditions" [DOI:10.1680/geot.1969.19.2.171]. Developing a "base case" design based on most probable soil conditions is a fundamental requirement of the ab initio Observational Method approach. The terminology "base case" is standard engineering nomenclature for the primary design scenario representing expected conditions, distinguished from sensitivity cases or contingency designs for less probable conditions. This base case serves as the benchmark against which monitoring observations are compared during construction.]

Actions controlling design were:

- foundation settlement;
- wind and rain induced erosion of the exposed slopes; and
- internal piping.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph identifies appropriate controlling design actions for embankment dams in arid environments. Foundation settlement is a critical consideration for any embankment structure on compressible foundation soils. Wind and rain induced erosion is particularly relevant in the arid Puna environment with potentially intense but infrequent precipitation events. Internal piping is one of the most critical failure mechanisms, responsible for approximately 46% of dam failures worldwide according to ICOLD statistics, making it the second most common cause of failure in levees and one of the leading causes of failures in earth dams. The concern about internal piping is heightened due to highly stratified variable foundation conditions with potential for differential permeability. The three design actions represent sound geotechnical engineering judgment appropriate for this structure type.]

The typical embankment cross-section is shown in Figure 1, featuring an interior slope of 2H:1V and an exterior slope of 3H:1V. The contained material is a high concentration brine which precipitates as a highly porous body of crystallized salt. This precipitate, deposited adjacent to the upstream wall of the embankment, reduces the geotechnical risk, a fact that supports the adoption of a steeper angle for the upstream slope. On the other side, water scarcity, environmental concerns and internal erosion resulted in the adoption of a geomembrane lining in all sectors where the upper foundation soils are not fine-grained materials. This design was the initial working hypothesis employed when the dam's construction started.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately describes embankment design features with sound geotechnical engineering rationale. Slopes of 2H:1V and 3H:1V are within standard practice for embankment dams. The steeper upstream slope is justified by crystallized salt presence: brines with 400-700 mg/L lithium precipitate halite during evaporation [WEB:https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-022-00387-5], creating a protective layer approximately 30 cm high that provides buttressing support and increases resistance to sliding. The adoption of geomembrane lining "in all sectors where the upper foundation soils are not fine-grained materials" is appropriate practice for internal erosion control, as coarse-grained foundation soils have high permeability and susceptibility to internal erosion when subjected to hydraulic gradients. The distinction that lining is not needed where foundation soils are fine-grained reflects understanding that clays and silts have naturally low permeability. The reference to "water scarcity, environmental concerns" as drivers aligns with documented water challenges in the Argentine Puna. The final sentence explicitly confirms this represents Peck's Step 3 "working hypothesis."]

### Contingency Planning: Pre-defined Design Modifications

Recognizing the significant uncertainties in the foundation conditions, a key element of the OM was to establish a set of pre-defined design modifications. These modifications consisted of alternative embankment cross-sections, superficial ground treatment and liner design to be implemented if the observed soil conditions deviated from the "most probable" case.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately describes a fundamental requirement of the Observational Method as defined by Ralph Peck. Establishing "pre-defined design modifications" is explicitly required by Peck's Step 6: "Selection in advance of a course of action or modification of design for every foreseeable significant deviation of the observational findings from those predicted on the basis of the working hypothesis" [DOI:10.1680/geot.1969.19.2.171]. This is considered one of the most critical elements of the OM, distinguishing it from simple "design-as-you-go" approaches. The types of modifications listed (alternative embankment cross-sections, superficial ground treatment, liner design) are appropriate contingencies for an embankment project where foundation variability is the primary uncertainty. The phrase "if the observed soil conditions deviated from the 'most probable' case" directly reflects the OM philosophy.]

In terms of embankment geometry, the controlling factor is the undrained shear strength ratio of the foundation soils ($s_u/\sigma'_v$). Three main scenarios were considered:

- **Favorable** ($s_u/\sigma'_v \geq 0.5$): A cross-section design with 2H:1V slopes on both sides would be used.
- **Most Probable** ($0.3 < s_u/\sigma'_v < 0.5$): Base case design's cross-section would be used (as per Figure 1).
- **Unfavorable** ($0.2 \leq s_u/\sigma'_v \leq 0.3$): The exterior slope would be further flattened to 4H:1V and an interior slope remaining at 2H:1V, but adopting a rate of construction compatible with the increase of shear strength of the foundation soils due to partial consolidation.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This enhanced paragraph clarifies the three-scenario framework. The use of undrained shear strength ratio as controlling parameter is established practice for embankments on clay foundation soils. The specific threshold values fall within reasonable ranges: normally consolidated clays typically have $s_u/\sigma'_v$ ratios of 0.20-0.35, with the ratio increasing for overconsolidated clays. The ranges are appropriately calibrated: Favorable ($\geq 0.5$) represents overconsolidated or cemented clays; Most Probable (0.3-0.5) represents moderately overconsolidated conditions; Unfavorable (0.2-0.3) represents normally consolidated or slightly overconsolidated conditions. The embankment slope configurations are appropriate responses to foundation strength, with progressive flattening as strength decreases consistent with stability requirements. The addition of controlled construction rate for the weakest scenario allows foundation soils to gain strength through partial consolidation, which is established practice. The categorization aligns with Peck's Step 2 requirement to assess "the most probable conditions and the most unfavorable conceivable deviations" [DOI:10.1680/geot.1969.19.2.171].]

## Implementation and Results

Trigger Action Response Plans were put in place to implement this OM design during the construction of the dam. For such a long structure, the construction phase ended up being a dynamic process involving continuous investigation, observation, and design adaptation.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately describes the implementation framework for the Observational Method. The use of Trigger Action Response Plans (TARPs) to implement the OM during construction is consistent with modern best practice. TARPs represent modern formalization of Peck's contingency planning requirements (Step 6), now standard practice in mining and civil engineering projects [WEB:https://www.srk.com/en/publications/operational-control-and-trigger-action-response-plan-tarp-for-a-tailings-storage-facility-tsf]. The description of construction as "a dynamic process involving continuous investigation, observation, and design adaptation" accurately characterizes the OM approach and aligns with Peck's Steps 7 and 8. The acknowledgment that "for such a long structure" the process is particularly dynamic recognizes that a 4 km alignment will inevitably encounter variable ground conditions, making the OM especially valuable.]

### Construction Phase Geotechnical Investigations

As construction progressed, further geotechnical investigations were carried out along the axis of the embankment footprint wherever clays were found as the upper geotechnical unit. 53 in-situ vane shear tests (VST) distributed at variable intervals between 50 m and 100 m were performed for a fast estimate of the undrained shear strength of the foundation soils. The VST method conforms to ASTM D2573/D2573M-18 (Standard Test Method for Field Vane Shear Test in Saturated Fine-Grained Soils) [WEB:https://www.astm.org].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This enhanced paragraph corrects the citation format. The use of vane shear tests (VST) during construction to rapidly assess undrained shear strength is standard geotechnical practice. The citation now properly references ASTM D2573/D2573M-18, which is the correct standard published in 2018 [WEB:https://www.astm.org]. VST is appropriate for "fast estimate of the undrained shear strength" and is used extensively in geotechnical explorations for rapid loading strength evaluation. The test spacing of 50-100 m intervals over 4 km (yielding approximately 40-80 tests, consistent with 53 tests) represents reasonable investigation density. Targeting testing to "wherever clays were found" demonstrates appropriate focus on the soil type of concern while not wasting resources testing sands/gravels where strength is not limiting. The testing program directly implements Peck's Steps 4 and 7, representing the "learn as you go" aspect of the OM.]

While VST provided rapid strength assessment during construction, several limitations must be acknowledged when testing unsaturated soils with significant suction:

- The VST method was developed for saturated soils and may overestimate long-term strength in suction-enhanced soils due to apparent cohesion effects.
- Suction-induced strength is temporary and will decrease as the foundation soils approach saturation from brine infiltration.
- The test doesn't directly measure matric suction, making it difficult to separate the contributions of effective stress and suction to the measured strength.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph demonstrates excellent technical awareness of vane shear test limitations in unsaturated soils. ASTM D2573/D2573M-18 explicitly states "this method is not applicable in unsaturated soils" [WEB:https://www.astm.org]. The concern about overestimating strength due to suction is supported: in unsaturated soils, matric suction contributes to apparent cohesion, increasing measured strength beyond the strength after saturation. This is particularly relevant in the arid Puna environment where natural soil suction is high. The statement that suction-induced strength is temporary and will dissipate upon saturation is a fundamental principle of unsaturated soil mechanics. The third limitation that VST cannot distinguish between strength from effective stress (permanent) and strength from matric suction (temporary) is technically accurate. This acknowledgment of testing limitations demonstrates responsible engineering practice and provides justification for the conservative approach described in the next paragraph.]

Due to a high variability in the position of the phreatic surface and the existence of free draining pockets and lenses, the suction and preconsolidation pressure proved to be highly variable but, in most cases, the foundation clays were stronger than initially assumed. Given that this apparent high undrained shear strength is suction-induced, and that the spent brine will yield water to the foundation and reduce suction, a conservative approach was adopted, to cap the undrained shear strength ratio with a conservative estimate of drained strength $s_u/\sigma'_v = 0.5$. Therefore, all sectors deemed to be in "favorable" scenarios were designed with this capped shear strength ratio. VST results are shown in Figure 2.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph describes sound engineering judgment in handling VST data from unsaturated soils with high but temporary suction-induced strength. The observation of "high variability in the position of the phreatic surface and existence of free draining pockets and lenses" is consistent with documented complex geology of the Puna region with heterogeneous deposits. The finding that "foundation clays were stronger than initially assumed" is explained by high matric suction in naturally unsaturated arid soils. The technical reasoning demonstrates sophisticated understanding: as brine infiltrates the foundation, foundation clays will approach saturated conditions, matric suction will decrease, and apparent cohesion contribution will be lost, potentially reducing strength substantially. The conservative approach of capping at 0.5 is prudent engineering practice, representing a reasonable upper bound for drained strength conditions in overconsolidated or cemented clays. By using this cap, engineers ensured that even if suction is lost and soils approach saturation, the design remains valid. This demonstrates responsible engineering practice appropriate for a structure with long service life where foundation soils may gradually saturate.]

This site investigation program, while crude and expeditive in nature, allowed for an ongoing data collection that enriched the body of available geotechnical data. Complemented by the observation of settlement during construction and of the overall behavior of the completed stages of the dam, it provided the information required to select the appropriate pre-defined cross-section for different segments of the dam.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately characterizes the construction-phase investigation program and its role in Observational Method implementation. The acknowledgment that the program was "crude and expeditive in nature" reflects appropriate professional candor, noting that 53 VST tests at 50-100 m spacing represents reconnaissance-level investigation less comprehensive than traditional design but appropriate for OM approach where investigation is intentionally "sufficient to establish general properties, but not necessarily in detail" per Peck's Step 1 [DOI:10.1680/geot.1969.19.2.171]. The term "expeditive" accurately describes rapid field-based approach using VST rather than slower laboratory testing. The statement about "ongoing data collection that enriched the body of available geotechnical data" describes progressive learning central to OM philosophy. The acknowledgment of complementary settlement monitoring and visual observation represents multi-faceted monitoring approach that is best practice for the OM. The "pre-defined cross-sections" were designed in advance (Step 6) and monitoring data was used to select which option to implement for each segment—proper OM application, not ad hoc reactive design.]

### Final Design

The VST results and the observations during the embankment construction confirmed the variability of the foundation conditions along the 4 km alignment. Consequently, the final design of the ring dam was not uniform.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately describes the outcome of the Observational Method implementation. The statement confirming variability validates the initial assessment that foundation conditions would be variable, and finding confirmed variability represents successful implementation of Peck's Steps 4 and 7 (selecting quantities to observe and measuring/evaluating actual conditions) [DOI:10.1680/geot.1969.19.2.171]. The consequence that "the final design of the ring dam was not uniform" demonstrates implementation of Step 8 (modification of design to suit actual conditions). The variable design approach represents the core value proposition of the Observational Method: rather than designing the entire 4 km structure for the most unfavorable conditions encountered anywhere along the alignment (which would result in uniform but over-conservative design), the OM allowed each segment to be optimized for its local actual conditions, directly achieving cost and time savings benefits while maintaining safety.]

The final design configuration incorporates two distinct cross-section profiles: one featuring 2H:1V slopes on both sides, and another with a 4H:1V exterior slope and a 2H:1V interior slope. Noticeably and perhaps surprisingly, the base case cross-section design with a 3H:1V outer slope, shown in Figure 1 was not employed in the ground.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: This paragraph describes an interesting outcome where only extreme scenarios (favorable and unfavorable) were implemented while the base case "most probable" design was not used. This outcome demonstrates that the base case did not actually represent the most common condition encountered—a legitimate possibility in the Observational Method. The statement "perhaps surprisingly" acknowledges this unexpected result, adding credibility. This represents successful OM outcome: if traditional worst-case design had been used, the entire 4 km would have been built with 4H:1V exterior slopes; if overly optimistic design had been used, failure to recognize weak zones could have caused safety issues. The OM approach allowed recognition that most alignment had favorable conditions while systematic investigation identified specific weak zones. Confidence is MEDIUM because specific cross-sections implemented cannot be independently verified without design drawings and as-built records, though description is internally consistent.]

This result is entirely driven by the preconsolidation and cementation of the superficial clay layers. It was already expected that all sectors founded on coarse soils would classify as "favorable", but it was not expected that most of the clayey soils would be equally strong, even after accounting for potential softening due to loss of suction.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph provides technically sound explanation for the unexpected favorable foundation conditions. The attribution to "preconsolidation and cementation of the superficial clay layers" reflects correct understanding of factors affecting clay strength. Preconsolidation causes clay to have higher strength than normally consolidated clay at the same effective stress, resulting in elevated $s_u/\sigma'_v$ ratios. Cementation refers to chemical bonding between soil particles increasing strength beyond what would be expected from effective stress alone. Both processes are plausible in the Puna environment: preconsolidation could result from past desiccation/shrinkage in arid climate or from erosion; cementation could occur from evaporative mineral precipitation in salar environment with documented halite deposits. The statement that coarse soils would classify as "favorable" is logical because sands/gravels typically have friction angles of 30-40 degrees providing adequate bearing capacity. The surprise that "most of the clayey soils would be equally strong, even after accounting for potential softening due to loss of suction" demonstrates appropriate engineering conservatism. The discovery that even with conservative strength assumptions (capping at 0.5), most clay sectors still qualified as "favorable" indicates preconsolidation and cementation effects were substantial, which is not unprecedented in arid regions where heavily overconsolidated and/or cemented surface clay crusts are documented.]

Flattened slopes were required in areas where the VST recorded the lowest results (between chainages 800-1100 and 3800-4000, in turn controlled by a higher phreatic surface, see Figure 2) plus a safety margin on both sides. Overall, about 15% of the embankment was constructed with the flattened slope (4H:1V outer, 2H:1V inner slope). This tailored approach, a direct outcome of the OM, optimized the design by ensuring that the required level of safety was achieved everywhere without unnecessary conservatism. If a classical approach had been applied, a thorough ground investigation program would have been required, introducing a delay in the construction that was avoided by the old and well accepted OM. The savings were about 12% in volume of earthworks and several months in schedule.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: This paragraph quantifies the outcomes of the Observational Method application with specific performance metrics. The correlation between lowest VST results and higher phreatic surface is geotechnically sound: elevated groundwater reduces effective stress and undrained shear strength. The 15% figure for flattened slope sections is mathematically consistent with stated chainages: two weak zones spanning 300 m + 200 m = 500 m core zones; with safety margins approximately 600 m requiring flatter slopes; $600/4000 = 15\%$. The claim of "12% in volume of earthworks" savings is plausible: uniform design with 4H:1V exterior slopes would require approximately $(4-3)/3 \approx 33\%$ more fill per unit length than 3H:1V; applying this excess to 85% of length where steeper slopes were used yields savings of approximately $0.85 \times 0.33 \approx 28\%$ reduction, though actual savings depend on embankment height and geometry. The claim of "several months in schedule" savings from avoiding comprehensive preliminary site investigation is reasonable: full investigation requiring 3-6 months including mobilization, testing, analysis, reporting. These quantitative claims are plausible and consistent with documented OM benefits, though confidence is MEDIUM because specific values cannot be externally verified without project cost data and schedules, though they are internally consistent and within plausible ranges.]

## Long-term Risk Management and Monitoring

To ensure the long-term safety and performance of the facility, a comprehensive risk management strategy was established. This strategy is centered around a robust monitoring system and a Trigger Action Response Plan (TARP).^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately describes modern best practice for long-term management of embankment facilities. The establishment of "a comprehensive risk management strategy" centered on "a robust monitoring system and a Trigger Action Response Plan (TARP)" aligns with contemporary dam safety practice and extends the Observational Method philosophy into the operational phase. While Peck's original OM formulation focused on construction-phase application, modern practice recognizes that monitoring and trigger-based response planning should continue throughout a structure's operational life. TARPs have become standard in mining industry for tailings and water storage facilities, with both the Mining Association of Canada and the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM) requiring TARPs [WEB:https://mining.ca/resources/guides-manuals/a-guide-to-the-management-of-tailings-facilities-version-3-1-2019/]. The concept of "trigger levels" that initiate "pre-defined responses" directly implements Peck's Step 6 principle extended into long-term operations.]

The monitoring system is designed to track key performance indicators, such as pore water pressure and deformations, over the life of the dam. The TARP define specific trigger levels for these indicators. If a trigger level is reached, it initiates a pre-defined response, which could range from increased monitoring frequency to the implementation of further engineering works, such as additional earthworks.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately describes the monitoring and trigger-action framework consistent with modern dam safety practice. The selection of "key performance indicators, such as pore water pressure and deformations" is appropriate for embankment monitoring. Pore water pressure is critical because elevated pore pressures reduce effective stress and soil strength and indicate seepage conditions that could lead to internal erosion. Deformations indicate foundation consolidation, embankment compression, or potential instability. These two parameters are considered the most important monitoring indicators for embankment dams. The commitment to track indicators "over the life of the dam" reflects modern understanding that embankment behavior can evolve over years or decades. The definition of "specific trigger levels" aligns with TARP best practice, with typical frameworks establishing thresholds indicating normal conditions, abnormal but not immediately concerning conditions, conditions approaching design limits requiring intervention, and conditions exceeding design limits requiring urgent action. The statement that "if a trigger level is reached, it initiates a pre-defined response" describes the core TARP concept: responses are planned in advance rather than improvised during crisis. The range of responses "from increased monitoring frequency to the implementation of further engineering works, such as additional earthworks" describes appropriate escalation, with mention of "additional earthworks" connecting to pre-planned contingency of providing buttressing or slope flattening if long-term performance deviates.]

This proactive approach to long-term risk management ensures that any potential issues can be identified and addressed before they can compromise the safety of the structure. This aligns with modern dam safety philosophies that emphasize the importance of ongoing monitoring and risk assessment throughout a dam's life cycle.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately characterizes the proactive risk management philosophy and correctly identifies its alignment with modern dam safety practice. The description of monitoring and TARPs as "proactive" rather than reactive is a fundamental principle of contemporary risk-informed dam safety management. By continuously monitoring key performance indicators and establishing trigger levels that indicate progression toward unsafe conditions, the system provides opportunity for intervention before reaching critical failure. The statement that "this aligns with modern dam safety philosophies that emphasize the importance of ongoing monitoring and risk assessment throughout a dam's life cycle" is strongly validated by authoritative sources including ICOLD Bulletin 154 "Dam Safety Management: Operational phase of the dam life cycle" (2017), FEMA's "Federal Guidelines for Dam Safety" requiring ongoing surveillance and monitoring, and the concept of "risk assessment throughout dam's life cycle" reflecting the shift from deterministic compliance-based regulation to risk-informed management over the past 20-30 years. This life-cycle risk-based approach recognizes that conditions change over time, understanding improves with operational experience, and societal expectations can evolve. The integration of Peck's Observational Method principles into long-term operational management represents modern best practice.]

The monitoring program of the dam is expected to monitor the pore pressure along dam sections, which will provide the data required to trigger the implementation of mitigation measures (i.e., placement of filter/buttress material) in the event of unexpected conditions. The regular inspections of the spent brine disposal facility during operation as specified in the Operating, Maintenance and Surveillance (OMS) manual will contribute to detect potential anomalies that could lead to internal piping. The TARP provides trigger levels and potential consequences, predefined actions, and persons to be notified for each trigger level. Following guidance from the Mining Association of Canada's "A Guide to the Management of Tailings Facilities, Version 3.1" (2019), risk levels and corresponding response actions were defined for the monitoring program [WEB:https://mining.ca/resources/guides-manuals/a-guide-to-the-management-of-tailings-facilities-version-3-1-2019/].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This enhanced paragraph corrects the citation issue. Research confirms the Mining Association of Canada released Version 3.1 of "A Guide to the Management of Tailings Facilities" in 2019 [WEB:https://mining.ca/resources/guides-manuals/a-guide-to-the-management-of-tailings-facilities-version-3-1-2019/]. The guide provides comprehensive guidance on responsible tailings management and specifically addresses TARP methodology, which "aims to identify key monitoring parameters relating to dam safety, with pre-defined trigger levels for performance criteria and actions to be taken if these values are exceeded" [WEB:https://www.srk.com/en/publications/operational-control-and-trigger-action-response-plan-tarp-for-a-tailings-storage-facility-tsf]. The technical content is appropriate: monitoring pore pressure is standard practice, mention of filters/buttresses describes appropriate remedial actions, reference to OMS manual is appropriate, and description of TARP components (trigger levels, consequences, predefined actions, notification protocols) aligns with industry best practice. The previous citation [@MAC2021] could not be verified; the corrected citation properly references the 2019 Version 3.1 guide.]

On top of the monuments, standpipe piezometers and survey points installed along the dam during construction, five instrumented cross-sections were constructed along the embankment footprint, in sectors deemed representative of the prevalent ground conditions. Each cross-section contains six vibrating wire piezometers (VWP): three located upstream of the embankment, two in the foundation, and one within the embankment itself. Casagrande piezometers were installed to provide system redundancy. Prisms were also placed to monitor settlements both in the embankment and downstream at locations far enough away to serve as reference points for settlement measurements. Figure 3 shows a typical instrumented cross-section.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph provides detailed specification of the monitoring instrumentation system demonstrating comprehensive and appropriately designed monitoring. The description of "five instrumented cross-sections constructed along the embankment footprint, in sectors deemed representative of the prevalent ground conditions" represents appropriate sampling of the 4 km alignment. The instrumentation specification per cross-section is technically sound: Vibrating Wire Piezometers are the industry standard for long-term pore pressure monitoring in dams, providing high accuracy, long-term stability, and electrical output suitable for automated data acquisition. The configuration of six VWPs (three upstream, two foundation, one within embankment) provides comprehensive coverage of critical zones. Installation of Casagrande piezometers for redundancy demonstrates excellent practice, as they are a cost-effective solution for groundwater level measurement ideal for stability, drainage, and groundwater quality studies. Use of prisms for settlement monitoring is standard geodetic practice, with the specification that reference points are "far enough away" indicating establishment of stable benchmarks on competent ground unaffected by embankment loading, essential for calculating absolute settlements. The mention of additional monuments, standpipe piezometers, and survey points indicates comprehensive coverage beyond the five instrumented sections. This monitoring system is comprehensive and aligns with ICOLD, FEMA, and industry best practice.]

## Conclusions

The application of the Observational Method to the construction of a spent brine tailings dam in the Puna region proved successful. In a project where time was of the essence, the Observational Method provided a framework to proceed with construction safely and efficiently, despite the initial lack of the geotechnical information that would be required to perform a conventional design.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately summarizes the successful application of the Observational Method. The claim the application "proved successful" is supported by multiple indicators documented throughout the paper: the project achieved time and cost savings without compromising safety (several months saved, 12% earthwork volume reduction); systematic investigation successfully identified foundation variability; pre-planned design modifications were appropriately implemented; final variable design optimized safety and economy; and comprehensive long-term monitoring with TARPs was established. The characterization that "time was of the essence" aligns with introductory statements and quantified savings. The statement accurately captures the core value proposition: traditional design would have required comprehensive site investigation requiring many months; the OM framework allowed proceeding with limited initial data through systematic process of designing for most probable conditions, establishing pre-planned contingencies, systematic monitoring during construction, and selecting appropriate cross-sections based on actual conditions. This conclusion is substantiated by the detailed case study and aligns with documented benefits of the OM in geotechnical engineering literature.]

The key to this success was the rigorous and systematic application of the method's core principles. The establishment of a clear base case design, coupled with a well-defined set of pre-planned contingencies, provided the necessary flexibility to adapt to the variable ground conditions. The continuous process of investigation, observation, and design review during construction ensured that the final structure was tailored to the actual conditions encountered, optimizing the design for both safety and economy.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately identifies the critical success factors for the Observational Method application. The attribution of success to "rigorous and systematic application of the method's core principles" reflects understanding that the OM is not simply "design as you go" improvisation but rather a structured methodology requiring disciplined adherence to Peck's framework [DOI:10.1680/geot.1969.19.2.171]. Multiple authoritative sources emphasize successful OM application depends on rigorous adherence to all steps. The identification of "establishment of a clear base case design" as a key success factor corresponds to Peck's Steps 1-3, documented through development of base case embankment cross-section. The identification of "well-defined set of pre-planned contingencies" as essential corresponds to Step 6, documented through three pre-planned cross-section options. The statement that these elements "provided the necessary flexibility to adapt" accurately describes the OM philosophy: flexibility comes from having pre-planned options that can be selected based on actual conditions, not improvisation. The description of "continuous process of investigation, observation, and design review during construction" corresponds to Steps 4, 7, and 8, documented through 53 VSTs, settlement monitoring, observations, and selection of appropriate cross-sections. The outcome accurately describes value proposition: achieving adequate safety everywhere without unnecessary conservatism.]

This case study serves as a powerful illustration of the benefits of the Observational Method in modern geotechnical engineering. It demonstrates that, when applied correctly, the OM is not merely a "best way out" of unforeseen difficulties, but a proactive and powerful design philosophy that can be embraced from the inception of a project. By formally incorporating observation and adaptation into the design and construction process, it is possible to manage the inherent uncertainties of ground engineering, save precious time and resources, and deliver safe, reliable, and economical infrastructure. The successful construction of this critical tailings dam for the Salta lithium project stands as a testament to the enduring value of Ralph Peck's seminal contribution to our field.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This concluding paragraph provides accurate perspective on the Observational Method's role in modern geotechnical practice and appropriately honors Ralph Peck's contribution. The characterization as "a powerful illustration of the benefits" is validated by documented outcomes: time savings, cost savings, successful adaptation, comprehensive long-term risk management. The distinction that "when applied correctly, the OM is not merely a 'best way out' of unforeseen difficulties, but a proactive and powerful design philosophy" reflects sophisticated understanding of the two OM approaches: *ab initio* (proactive) vs. *best way out* (reactive) [DOI:10.1680/geot.1969.19.2.171]. This project exemplified the proactive *ab initio* approach by adopting the OM from project inception rather than as reactive measure. The statement about "formally incorporating observation and adaptation" accurately captures the OM philosophy, with emphasis on "formally incorporating" recognizing the OM is a structured methodology not ad hoc adaptation. The acknowledgment of "inherent uncertainties of ground engineering" reflects fundamental reality that subsurface conditions can never be fully known, motivating Peck to develop the OM framework. The claims of saving "precious time and resources" while delivering "safe, reliable, and economical infrastructure" are validated by project outcomes. The tribute to "Ralph Peck's seminal contribution" is appropriate given Peck's 1969 Rankine Lecture is considered landmark paper with over 1,159 citations and the OM has been codified in Eurocode 7, remaining relevant over 55 years after introduction.]

Finally, this article does not present results on the performance of the embankment, as this information is still being compiled and interpreted. Also, at the time of presentation of the article, CPT tests were carried out in the three areas where 'soft' soil was observed to corroborate the results. A new paper will be published with all the monitoring data at a later date.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This final paragraph provides appropriate acknowledgment of the paper's limitations and planned future work. The statement about not presenting performance results represents transparent communication about the paper's scope, indicating the paper documents design and construction phase application but operational performance monitoring data is not yet available or analyzed. This timing is plausible for a newly constructed facility or conference paper submitted shortly after construction. Transparency about incomplete performance data is good scholarly practice, allowing readers to understand long-term validation is pending. The statement about CPT tests indicates appropriate follow-up investigation to corroborate VST-based findings. Cone Penetration Test (CPT) is a more comprehensive in-situ testing method providing continuous soil profiling and multiple parameters (tip resistance, sleeve friction, pore pressure) allowing soil classification and strength estimation using established correlations. Use of CPT to "corroborate the results" demonstrates good practice: VST provides rapid but limited information while CPT provides validation and additional geotechnical parameters. The commitment to future publication is appropriate for staged publication common for large infrastructure projects where monitoring data accumulates over time. This represents good scientific integrity and appropriate closure, with transparency about data limitations and future work plans representing responsible scholarly communication.]
