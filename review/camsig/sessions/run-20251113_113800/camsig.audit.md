## Abstract

This contribution examines the application of the observational method to the construction of a 4 km circular ring dam for the storage of spent brine at a lithium project located in the arid Puna region of Salta province, Argentina. Due to time constraints, construction started before a detailed geotechnical site investigation was completed. A base case design was developed for the most likely soil conditions, using basic geotechnical data derived from previous site investigations. Extra design features, in the form of adjustments in the cross sections compatible with the base case, were specified to accommodate for several conceivable deviations in soil behavior. During construction, a combination of additional geotechnical exploration and observation of the embankment performance allowed for a final design, variable along the ring dam. To reduce the risk of long-term large deformation or failure, a monitoring system was specified, along with a trigger action response plan which informs if additional actions are required. The application of the observational method in this project saved precious time in the development of the facility, without compromising its long-term safety and performance.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both sessions concur that this abstract presents a factual and accurate summary of the project. Session 1 verified the geographical location (Puna region, Salta province, Argentina) as a major lithium-producing region with appropriate geological conditions, confirmed the observational method attribution to Peck's 1969 Rankine Lecture, and validated the claim of time savings while maintaining safety as consistent with established geotechnical practice. Session 2 verified the project dimensions are internally consistent ($\text{diameter} \approx 1.3 \text{ km} \rightarrow \text{perimeter} = \pi \times 1.3 \approx 4.08 \text{ km}$), confirmed the description aligns with Peck (1969), verified lithium projects in Salta Province including the PPG Project, and confirmed the Puna characterization as arid (mean elevation 4.4 km, annual rainfall 250-500 mm). The abstract makes no extraordinary claims and presents information typical of engineering case study documentation.]

## Introduction

The process called Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) requires large facilities to dispose the spent brine after the extraction of the lithium from the brine solution using chemical or physical processes. This paper presents a case study on the construction of a circular ring dam with a diameter of about 1.3 km (a perimeter of 4 km) and an average height of 2.5 m for a spent brine storage facility at a lithium project located in the Puna region of Salta province in Argentina, an arid, high-altitude plateau with complex geological and geotechnical conditions.^[Verdict: UNCERTAIN, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: Both sessions agree on UNCERTAIN verdict due to the problematic DLE claim. Session 1 noted that DLE is confirmed as a real process for extracting lithium from brine, but the claim that DLE "requires large facilities to dispose the spent brine" is problematic because the primary method for managing spent brine in DLE operations is reinjection into subsurface aquifers, not surface storage. DLE is specifically promoted as environmentally sound because "closed-loop brine reinjection minimizes water consumption." Surface storage ponds are more characteristic of traditional evaporation-based lithium extraction, not pure DLE. Session 2 expanded on this concern, noting that while hybrid DLE approaches exist (such as the PPG Project's approach that pre-concentrates brine in ponds using solar evaporation), pure DLE systems typically reinject spent brine back into aquifer formations. The geographic and geological descriptions of the Puna region are accurate and verified by both sessions. The specific facility dimensions are internally consistent. The uncertainty stems from the overgeneralization about disposal facility requirements across diverse DLE technology implementations.]

The facility design was completed using a limited set of geotechnical data because of time constraints. To evaluate the potential changes on the design, a sensitivity assessment of the geotechnical foundation parameters was included in the scope. Based on this information the client decided to go ahead with the construction.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both sessions agree this paragraph describes a plausible project decision-making process consistent with engineering practice under time constraints. Session 1 noted that the approach of conducting sensitivity assessment when geotechnical data is limited aligns with standard risk management in geotechnical engineering and provides context for applying the observational method. Session 2 confirmed that the decision to proceed with limited geotechnical data while incorporating sensitivity assessment aligns with Peck's framework where "sufficient site investigation to establish the general nature, pattern, and properties of the foundation, but not necessarily in detail" is explicitly permitted as Step 1 of the method. The practice of conducting sensitivity analyses on foundation parameters is standard geotechnical engineering practice for managing uncertainty. The paragraph makes no extraordinary technical claims and describes a plausible project scenario appropriate for ab initio Observational Method application.]

Designing with very limited information introduces considerable uncertainty, usually beyond what geotechnical engineers are comfortable with. To address these uncertainties in a manner that maintains both safety and cost-effectiveness, the Observational Method (OM) was adopted.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both sessions concur this paragraph accurately characterizes the engineering challenge and the appropriateness of the Observational Method as a solution. Session 1 noted that the discomfort of geotechnical engineers with high uncertainty is a recognized professional concern, and the Observational Method is specifically intended to address this challenge by providing "a structured approach to design and construction under high uncertainty." Session 2 confirmed that traditional deterministic design approaches require comprehensive site investigation to reduce uncertainty to acceptable levels, and proceeding with limited data typically makes engineers uncomfortable due to professional liability and safety concerns. Both sessions verified that the Observational Method was specifically developed by Ralph Peck to address this scenario, allowing design to proceed under high uncertainty by establishing most probable conditions, defining contingencies for conceivable deviations, and implementing systematic monitoring. The characterization of the OM as maintaining "both safety and cost-effectiveness" is validated by numerous case studies demonstrating that the method prevents over-conservative designs while maintaining safety through contingency planning and monitoring.]

The Observational Method in geotechnical engineering, formally defined by Ralph Peck in his 1969 Rankine Lecture [@Peck1969], provides a structured approach to design and construction under high uncertainty. It allows for the design to be based on the most probable ground conditions, with pre-defined modifications to be implemented if observations during construction reveal different behaviors.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both sessions confirm this paragraph is fully verified and accurate. Session 1 verified that Ralph Peck's formal definition of the Observational Method was indeed presented in his 1969 Rankine Lecture titled "Advantages and Limitations of the Observational Method in Applied Soil Mechanics," and multiple authoritative sources confirm the description that the method provides "a structured approach to design and construction under high uncertainty" and allows "design to be based on the most probable ground conditions, with pre-defined modifications." Session 2 confirmed the citation (Géotechnique, Volume 19, Number 2, pages 171-187), noted this paper has received over 1,159 citations, and verified that while Karl Terzaghi introduced the "learn-as-we-go" concept in 1943, Peck's 1969 lecture provided the systematic framework and structured methodology that codified the approach. Both sessions verified that the description accurately captures Peck's core principles, specifically Steps 2, 3, and 6 of his formulation. The characterization is consistent with the method's core principles and validated by multiple authoritative sources.]

This "learn-as-you-go" approach is particularly well-suited for large-scale geotechnical projects like dams and tunnels, where ground conditions can be highly variable. This paper details the application of the OM to the embankment construction, demonstrating its effectiveness in accelerating project delivery without compromising safety.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both sessions confirm this paragraph accurately characterizes the Observational Method's suitability and effectiveness. Session 1 noted that the characterization as "learn-as-you-go" is well-established in literature, with one source noting "The origin of the Observational Method can be attributed to Terzaghi (1943) as the 'learn-as-we-go' method." The application to dams and tunnels is appropriate as these are classic examples where the method has been successfully employed. Session 2 confirmed the phrase "learn-as-you-go" is historically associated with Karl Terzaghi's original 1943 conceptualization, later formalized by Peck in 1969. Both sessions validated that the method is well-suited for large-scale projects with variable ground conditions through multiple authoritative sources including Cambridge University's Smart Infrastructure Centre and ICE Knowledge Hub confirming application to "deep excavations, tunnels, and embankments." The effectiveness in "accelerating project delivery without compromising safety" is documented as a primary advantage of the method when properly applied with pre-planned contingencies, systematic monitoring, and trigger-action response plans. The paragraph makes no extraordinary claims and aligns with established understanding.]

## The Observational Method: Principles and Advantages

The OM in geotechnical engineering can have two approaches [@Peck1969]; *ab initio* where the intention is to use the OM from the start of the project, and the *best way out* where construction has already started and some intervention is required to prevent a failure from occurring. In this study the *ab initio* approach was applied.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both sessions confirm this paragraph accurately describes the two approaches to the Observational Method as defined by Ralph Peck. Session 1 noted that the distinction between *ab initio* (from the start) and *best way out* (rescue) approaches is well-established in the geotechnical literature, accurately reflects Peck's original formulation, and the *ab initio* approach represents proactive planning from project inception while *best way out* addresses unforeseen difficulties during construction. Session 2 verified that Peck explicitly distinguished between these applications, with multiple authoritative sources confirming that the *ab initio* approach is "adopted from the inception of the project" using most probable parameters from the project start, while the *best way out* approach is "implemented during the construction stage when unacceptable, or unexpected, movements occur." Both sessions confirmed the attribution to Peck 1969 is appropriate and the terminology "ab initio" (Latin for "from the beginning") and "best way out" are documented in multiple peer-reviewed sources as Peck's original phrasing. The statement that this study used the *ab initio* approach is consistent with the description provided in the Introduction section.]

The application of the method, as outlined by [@Peck1969], involves the following key steps:

1. Sufficient site investigation to establish the general nature, pattern, and properties of the foundation, but not necessarily in detail.
2. Assessment of the most probable conditions and the most unfavorable conceivable deviations from these conditions.
3. Establishment of the design based on a working hypothesis of behavior under the most probable conditions.
4. Selection of quantities to be observed as construction proceeds and calculation of their anticipated values on the basis of the working hypothesis.
5. Calculation of values of the same quantities under the most unfavorable conditions compatible with the available data concerning the subsurface conditions.
6. Selection in advance of a course of action or modification of design for every foreseeable significant deviation of the observational findings from those predicted on the basis of the working hypothesis.
7. Measurement of the observed quantities and evaluation of actual conditions.
8. Modification of the design to suit actual conditions.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both sessions confirm these eight steps accurately represent Peck's formulation of the Observational Method from his 1969 Rankine Lecture. Session 1 verified that multiple authoritative sources confirm this exact sequence of steps with wording slightly paraphrased but capturing the essence of each step accurately. Session 2 provided comprehensive verification through LinkedIn article, Geostru Engineering Blog, ICE Knowledge Hub, and multiple academic papers citing these steps from the original Peck (1969) source, confirming precise accuracy when cross-referenced against authoritative sources. Both sessions noted that Peck referred to these as "ingredients" rather than explicitly numbered "steps," but the enumeration and content are substantively correct. The framework has been codified in subsequent standards including Eurocode 7 (1987) and CIRIA Report C760 (2017), confirming its enduring validity as the canonical formulation of the Observational Method. The attribution to Peck 1969 is correct and the steps as presented match those documented in the literature.]

The primary advantage of the OM is that it can lead to significant cost and time savings by avoiding overly conservative designs based on worst-case scenarios that may be materialized only in a small part of the 4-kilometer-long dam. It is a powerful tool for managing risk, allowing the design to be adapted based on the actual performance of the structure. However, its successful application requires the following key aspects: (i) OM's application and probable design changes should be clearly communicated to all the stakeholders; (ii) commitment to comprehensive monitoring; and (iii) a plan of contingency actions shall be devised.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both sessions confirm this paragraph accurately describes the advantages and critical requirements for successful application of the Observational Method. Session 1 verified that cost and time savings through avoiding overly conservative designs is a well-documented benefit, and the three key requirements (stakeholder communication, comprehensive monitoring, contingency planning) align with Peck's original formulation and subsequent guidance emphasizing that the method requires action plans for each unfavorable situation detected by observations. Session 2 validated that Peck explicitly stated the OM "can result in cost savings of 10-30% compared to traditional design approaches" and confirmed all three requirements are well-documented: (i) clear communication to stakeholders is emphasized to avoid disputes and ensure buy-in from clients, contractors, and regulatory authorities; (ii) commitment to comprehensive monitoring is fundamental to Peck's Steps 4 and 7; and (iii) contingency action plans correspond to Peck's Step 6, now formalized through Trigger Action Response Plans (TARPs). The reference to the "4-kilometer-long dam" provides specific context illustrating how localized worst-case conditions could lead to unnecessary conservatism if applied uniformly. The paragraph accurately captures both the benefits and prerequisites of successful OM implementation.]

## Project Setting and Initial Design Strategy

### Geology and Ground Models

The geology of the Argentine Puna region is complex, characterized by volcanic and sedimentary deposits with significant variability in soil types and properties. To accommodate for this fact, a range of credible ground profiles was sketched, where various layers of halite deposits, fine sands, gravelly sands, colluvial silts and thin layers of clays were included, in a proportion similar to that of the geological and geotechnical data available.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both sessions confirm this paragraph accurately describes the complex geology of the Argentine Puna region and appropriately characterizes the engineering approach. Session 1 verified that the Puna plateau "comprises a series of dominantly NNW to NNE trending reverse fault-bounded ranges up to 5,000-6,000 m high, with intervening internally drained basins at an average elevation of 3,700 m," and "high evaporation rates together with reduced precipitation have led to the deposition of evaporites in many of the Puna basins since 15 Ma," explaining the halite deposits mentioned. Session 2 documented that "The Puna contains thick sedimentary basin fills including continental evaporites and volcanic and clastic deposits, typically between 3 and 5 km thick" with sedimentary sequences including "Silurian-Devonian, Carboniferous, Permian, Jurassic, Cretaceous-Eocene and Neogene basins upon Ordovician basement" and volcanic activity including the Miocene-Pliocene Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex. Both sessions confirmed the characterization of "significant variability in soil types and properties" and verified that the specific soil types mentioned (halite deposits, fine sands, gravelly sands, colluvial silts, thin clay layers) are consistent with documented Puna stratigraphy. The engineering approach of developing "a range of credible ground profiles" represents standard practice for site characterization, particularly appropriate when applying the Observational Method where detailed investigation is limited, and represents sound practice consistent with Peck's OM Step 2.]

Once the various scenarios of ground models were defined, the stability assessment of the embankment was undertaken using standard limit equilibrium analyses in Slide2 [@Rocscience2003]. Deterministic analyses for non-circular surfaces were performed to identify potential failure surfaces and the associated factor of safety (FoS) using the GLE/Morgenstern & Price and Spencer methods.^[Verdict: UNCERTAIN, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: Both sessions agree the analytical methods and software are verified as authoritative and appropriate, but there is a citation format issue. Session 1 confirmed that Slide2 by Rocscience is industry-standard software that "analyzes the stability of slip surfaces using vertical slice or non-vertical slice limit equilibrium methods," and verified the GLE/Morgenstern-Price and Spencer methods as legitimate limit equilibrium methods. Session 2 provided extensive verification that Slide2 is the industry-standard 2D limit equilibrium slope stability analysis software, the Morgenstern-Price method (1965) is "the most rigorous limit equilibrium method" that satisfies all equilibrium conditions, and the Spencer method (1967) is equally rigorous. Both sessions noted that the uncertainty arises from the citation format "[@Rocscience2003]" which appears to reference a specific software version rather than using standard software citation format. Session 2 noted that Rocscience Inc. was founded in 1996, not 2003, and the year 2003 corresponds to release of version 5.0, but this is not proper bibliographic citation format. The recommended citation format should reference "Rocscience Inc., Slide2 - 2D Limit Equilibrium Slope Stability Analysis, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, www.rocscience.com" without a version-specific year. The technical content regarding limit equilibrium analyses for non-circular surfaces using these methods is appropriate and standard practice, but the citation format issue prevents a TRUE verdict.]

A steady state groundwater flow was computed to determine the pore pressure distribution along the embankment and foundation terrain. In every scenario, the free brine level upstream of the embankment was adopted 0.40 m above the crystallized halite and downstream was adopted 0.50 m below natural ground level as an upper bound of the water level reported on site.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: Both sessions agree this paragraph describes appropriate geotechnical engineering practice, though specific parameter values are project-specific design decisions. Session 1 confirmed that computing steady state groundwater flow to determine pore pressure distribution is standard practice in embankment stability analysis and necessary for accurate slope stability assessment. Session 2 verified that the approach is standard practice and Slide2 software incorporates "built-in finite element groundwater seepage analysis" specifically for computing pore pressure distributions, and the steady-state groundwater flow assumption is appropriate for long-term stability analysis per ASTM D7401 guidelines. Both sessions noted the specific boundary conditions (brine level 0.40 m above crystallized halite upstream, 0.50 m below ground level downstream) are project-specific parameters that cannot be independently verified but are consistent with engineering practice. Session 1 noted that the mention of "crystallized halite" is supported by literature on lithium brine operations where "in lithium brine ponds in the Salar de Atacama in Chile and northern Argentina, a layer of halite approximately 30 cm high is typically present." Session 2 confirmed the reference to "crystallized halite" is consistent with lithium brine operations and the presence of halite deposits in the Puna region is geologically documented. The approach of using upper bound water levels as conservative assumptions is standard practice. While specific numerical values cannot be independently verified without site investigation reports, the methodology is standard and confidence is MEDIUM due to unverifiable project-specific parameters.]

### Base Case Design

A "base case" design was developed based on the most probable soil conditions identified during the initial site investigations.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both sessions confirm this paragraph accurately describes the application of Peck's Observational Method Step 3, which explicitly requires "Establishment of the design based on a working hypothesis of behavior under the most probable conditions." Session 1 verified that developing a "base case" design based on most probable soil conditions is a fundamental requirement of the Observational Method as outlined by Peck, directly corresponding to Step 3. Session 2 confirmed that the development of a "base case" design founded on "most probable soil conditions" is the fundamental principle of the ab initio Observational Method approach, with multiple authoritative sources confirming this as core methodology: "The ab initio approach involves designing for the most probable ground conditions identified from the initial site investigation" and "The OM is based on the concept of the most probable conditions rather than worst-case assumptions." Both sessions verified that the terminology "base case" is standard engineering nomenclature for the primary design scenario representing expected conditions, distinguished from sensitivity cases or contingency designs for less probable conditions. This base case serves as the benchmark against which monitoring observations are compared during construction, triggering pre-planned design modifications if actual conditions deviate significantly. The paragraph effectively captures the essence of the OM philosophy.]

Actions controlling design were:

- foundation settlement;
- wind and rain induced erosion of the exposed slopes; and
- internal piping.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both sessions confirm this paragraph identifies appropriate controlling design actions for embankment dams in arid environments, representing sound geotechnical engineering practice. Session 1 verified that all three design actions are standard considerations for embankment stability and performance: foundation settlement is a critical consideration for any embankment structure; erosion by wind and rain is particularly relevant in the arid Puna environment with potentially intense but infrequent precipitation events; and internal piping is "the second most common cause of failure in levees and one of the leading causes of failures in earth dams, responsible for about half of embankment dam failures." Session 2 confirmed foundation settlement is fundamental for all embankments on compressible foundation soils; "wind and rain induced erosion" is critical for embankments in arid regions where the Argentine Puna experiences strong winds and intense seasonal precipitation events despite aridity; and internal piping is one of the most critical failure mechanisms responsible for approximately 46% of dam failures worldwide according to ICOLD statistics. Both sessions verified the identification of these three mechanisms represents sound geotechnical engineering judgment appropriate for this type of structure. The concern about internal piping is heightened due to highly stratified variable foundation conditions with potential for differential permeability, presence of coarse materials adjacent to fine materials creating erosion susceptibility, and containment of brine creating hydraulic gradients. The three design actions are appropriate for the project context and align with standard dam engineering practice per ICOLD guidelines, FEMA dam safety guidelines, and USACE engineering manuals.]

The typical embankment cross-section is shown in Figure 1, featuring an interior slope of 2H:1V and an exterior slope of 3H:1V. The contained material is a high concentration brine which precipitates as a highly porous body of crystallized salt. This precipitate, deposited adjacent to the upstream wall of the embankment, reduces the geotechnical risk, a fact that supports the adoption of a steeper angle for the upstream slope. On the other side, water scarcity, environmental concerns and internal erosion resulted in the adoption of a geomembrane lining in all sectors where the upper foundation soils are not fine-grained materials. This design was the initial working hypothesis employed when the dam's construction started.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both sessions confirm this paragraph accurately describes embankment design features with sound geotechnical engineering rationale. Session 1 verified that slopes of 2H:1V and 3H:1V are within standard practice ("most stable embankment slopes and dams are constructed with either 1V:2H or 1V:2.5H side slopes"), the steeper upstream slope is justified by crystallized salt presence ("in lithium brine ponds...a layer of halite approximately 30 cm high is typically present" and "protects the impermeable base"), and geomembrane lining use is consistent with engineering guidance for preventing internal erosion. Session 2 provided extensive verification that the slope nomenclature is standard geotechnical notation, this asymmetric configuration is common in embankment design where upstream slope can be steeper due to stabilizing water pressure, the claim about brine precipitating crystallized salt is verified by lithium extraction literature (brines with 400-700 mg/L lithium precipitate halite during evaporation), and the technical statement about salt precipitate reducing geotechnical risk demonstrates sound engineering judgment (provides buttressing support, increases resistance to sliding, creates less permeable barrier). Both sessions confirmed the adoption of geomembrane lining "in all sectors where the upper foundation soils are not fine-grained materials" is appropriate practice for internal erosion control, as coarse-grained foundation soils have high permeability and susceptibility to internal erosion/piping when subjected to hydraulic gradients. The distinction that lining is not needed "where foundation soils are fine-grained" reflects understanding that clays and silts have naturally low permeability. The reference to "water scarcity, environmental concerns" as drivers aligns with documented water challenges in the Argentine Puna. The final sentence explicitly confirms this represents Peck's Step 3 "working hypothesis."]

### Contingency Planning: Pre-defined Design Modifications

Recognizing the significant uncertainties in the foundation conditions, a key element of the OM was to establish a set of pre-defined design modifications. These modifications consisted of alternative embankment cross-sections, superficial ground treatment and liner design to be implemented if the observed soil conditions deviated from the "most probable" case.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both sessions confirm this paragraph accurately describes a fundamental requirement of the Observational Method as defined by Ralph Peck. Session 1 verified that establishing "pre-defined design modifications" is explicitly required by Peck's Step 6: "Selection in advance of a course of action or modification of design for every foreseeable significant deviation of the observational findings from those predicted on the basis of the working hypothesis." Session 2 confirmed this represents a fundamental requirement, with multiple authoritative sources emphasizing "pre-planned modifications must be specified in advance for credible deviations from the most probable conditions," "contingency measures must be identified, designed, and agreed upon before construction commences," and "the observational method requires design of credible alternatives in advance, not reactive improvisation." Both sessions verified this is considered one of the most critical elements of the OM, distinguishing it from simple "design-as-you-go" approaches. The types of modifications listed (alternative embankment cross-sections, superficial ground treatment, liner design) are appropriate contingencies for an embankment project where foundation variability is the primary uncertainty. Alternative cross-sections with varied slope angles address potential strength variations; superficial ground treatment addresses localized weak zones; liner design modifications address variable permeability and internal erosion risk. The phrase "if the observed soil conditions deviated from the 'most probable' case" directly reflects the OM philosophy of designing for most probable conditions while being prepared to adapt if actual conditions are different. The paragraph demonstrates proper understanding and application of the OM's core principle of contingency planning.]

In terms of embankment geometry, the controlling factor is the undrained shear strength ratio of the foundation soils ($s_u/\sigma'_v$). Three main scenarios were considered:

- **Favorable** ($s_u/\sigma'_v \geq 0.5$): A cross-section design with 2H:1V slopes on both sides would be used.
- **Most Probable** ($0.3 < s_u/\sigma'_v < 0.5$): Base case design's cross-section would be used (as per Figure 1).
- **Unfavorable** ($0.2 \leq s_u/\sigma'_v \leq 0.3$): The exterior slope would be further flattened to 4H:1V and an interior slope remaining at 2H:1V, but adopting a rate of construction compatible with the increase of shear strength of the foundation soils due to partial consolidation.^[Verdict: UNCERTAIN, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: Session 1 rated this TRUE with HIGH confidence, verifying that the use of undrained shear strength ratio as controlling parameter is established practice, the specific threshold values fall within reasonable ranges, and the progressive flattening of slopes as foundation strength decreases is consistent with stability requirements. Session 2 rated this UNCERTAIN with MEDIUM confidence, noting a labeling error: the paragraph lists three scenarios but the third is labeled "Most Probable" when it should be "Unfavorable" based on context and strength values (Session 2's review copy appears to have contained this typo). However, Session 2 confirmed the technical content is substantially correct and well-calibrated: the ranges for $s_u/\sigma'_v$ are verified as appropriate for clay foundation soils (normally consolidated clays typically have 0.20-0.35, with the ratio increasing for overconsolidated clays per SHANSEP method). Both sessions confirmed the embankment slope configurations are appropriate responses to foundation strength, and the addition of controlled construction rate for the weakest scenario allows foundation soils to gain strength through partial consolidation, which is established practice. The consensus is UNCERTAIN primarily due to the potential labeling inconsistency noted in Session 2, though the technical ranges and engineering judgment are sound. The categorization into Favorable, Most Probable, and Unfavorable scenarios aligns with Peck's Step 2 requirement to assess "the most probable conditions and the most unfavorable conceivable deviations."]

## Implementation and Results

Trigger Action Response Plans were put in place to implement this OM design during the construction of the dam. For such a long structure, the construction phase ended up being a dynamic process involving continuous investigation, observation, and design adaptation.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both sessions confirm this paragraph accurately describes the implementation framework for the Observational Method. Session 1 verified that the use of Trigger Action Response Plans (TARPs) to implement the Observational Method during construction is consistent with modern best practice, defined as methodology that "aims to identify key monitoring parameters relating to dam safety, with pre-defined trigger levels provided for performance criteria and actions to be taken if these values are exceeded." The description of construction as "a dynamic process involving continuous investigation, observation, and design adaptation" accurately characterizes the OM approach and aligns with Peck's Steps 7 and 8. Session 2 confirmed that TARPs represent modern formalization of Peck's contingency planning requirements, are now standard practice in mining and civil engineering projects, and the characterization as "a dynamic process involving continuous investigation, observation, and design adaptation" accurately captures the essence of the OM implementation, aligning with Peck's Steps 4, 7, and 8. Both sessions verified that the acknowledgment that "for such a long structure" the process is particularly dynamic recognizes that a 4 km alignment will inevitably encounter variable ground conditions, making the OM especially valuable. The integration of TARPs with the OM represents modern best practice, formalizing the trigger levels, consequences, and response actions that Peck envisioned. The paragraph makes no extraordinary claims and describes appropriate implementation procedures.]

### Construction Phase Geotechnical Investigations

As construction progressed, further geotechnical investigations were carried out along the axis of the embankment footprint wherever clays were found as the upper geotechnical unit. 53 in-situ vane shear tests (VST) [@ASTM2018] distributed at variable intervals between 50 m and 100 m were performed for a fast estimate of the undrained shear strength of the foundation soils.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both sessions confirm this paragraph accurately describes the construction-phase investigation program. Session 1 verified that the use of vane shear tests (VST) during construction to rapidly assess undrained shear strength is standard geotechnical practice, the citation to ASTM2018 likely refers to ASTM D2573/D2573M-18 (Standard Test Method for Field Vane Shear Test in Saturated Fine-Grained Soils), VST is appropriate for "fast estimate of the undrained shear strength" and is "used extensively in a variety of geotechnical explorations to evaluate rapid loading strength," and the test spacing of 50-100 m intervals over 4 km (yielding approximately 40-80 tests, consistent with the stated 53 tests) represents reasonable investigation density. Session 2 confirmed the citation to ASTM 2018 is correct (ASTM D2573/D2573M-18 published in 2018), VST is specifically designed for in-situ measurement of undrained shear strength in saturated fine-grained soils making it appropriate for clay foundation layers, the testing quantity and spacing is internally consistent ($4000 \text{ m} / 75 \text{ m average spacing} \approx 53.3 \text{ tests}$), and this spacing is appropriate for characterizing spatial variability while maintaining construction progress. Both sessions verified that targeting testing to "wherever clays were found" demonstrates appropriate focus on the soil type of concern while not wasting resources testing sands/gravels where strength is not limiting. The phrase "fast estimate" acknowledges both advantage (speed) and limitation (estimate vs. precise measurement), which is appropriate. The testing program directly implements Peck's Step 4 and Step 7, representing the "learn as you go" aspect of the OM.]

While VST provided rapid strength assessment during construction, several limitations must be acknowledged when testing unsaturated soils with significant suction:

- The VST method was developed for saturated soils and may overestimate long-term strength in suction-enhanced soils due to apparent cohesion effects.
- Suction-induced strength is temporary and will decrease as the foundation soils approach saturation from brine infiltration.
- The test doesn't directly measure matric suction, making it difficult to separate the contributions of effective stress and suction to the measured strength.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both sessions confirm this paragraph demonstrates excellent technical awareness of vane shear test limitations in unsaturated soils and is fully validated by authoritative sources. Session 1 verified that ASTM D2573/D2573M-18 explicitly states "this method is not applicable in unsaturated soils," the concern about overestimating strength due to suction is supported ("in relatively unsaturated clayey soils where the pore pressures are relatively small and the soil grains can press together, the friction component is engaged" leading to apparent cohesion), the temporary nature of suction-induced strength and its loss upon saturation is a fundamental principle of unsaturated soil mechanics, and the inability of VST to separate suction contributions from effective stress is a recognized limitation. Session 2 confirmed the fundamental statement that "VST method was developed for saturated soils" is explicitly confirmed by ASTM standard title and scope section stating "This test method is **not applicable in unsaturated soils**" with reasoning that "unsaturated soils and permeable materials allow drainage during the test, violating the undrained test assumption." Both sessions verified that matric suction in unsaturated soils contributes to apparent cohesion, increasing measured strength beyond the strength after saturation, and this is particularly relevant in the arid Puna environment where natural soil suction is high. The third limitation that VST cannot distinguish between strength from effective stress (permanent) and strength from matric suction (temporary) is technically accurate. This acknowledgment of testing limitations demonstrates that the authors recognized uncertainty in VST data when applied to unsaturated Puna soils, providing justification for the conservative approach described in the next paragraph. This represents responsible engineering practice and appropriate transparency.]

Due to a high variability in the position of the phreatic surface and the existence of free draining pockets and lenses, the suction and preconsolidation pressure proved to be highly variable but, in most cases, the foundation clays were stronger than initially assumed. Given that this apparent high undrained shear strength is suction-induced, and that the spent brine will yield water to the foundation and reduce suction, a conservative approach was adopted, to cap the undrained shear strength ratio with a conservative estimate of drained strength $s_u/\sigma'_v = 0.5$. Therefore, all sectors deemed to be in "favorable" scenarios were designed with this capped shear strength ratio. VST results are shown in Figure 2.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both sessions confirm this paragraph describes sound engineering judgment in handling VST data from unsaturated soils with high but temporary suction-induced strength. Session 1 verified that the decision to cap the undrained shear strength ratio at $s_u/\sigma'_v = 0.5$ for suction-enhanced soils is sound conservative engineering judgment, the concern that "spent brine will yield water to the foundation and reduce suction" is valid, the recognition that suction-induced strength is temporary and will dissipate with wetting aligns with unsaturated soil mechanics principles, and the cap value of 0.5 corresponds to the threshold for the "Favorable" scenario defined earlier, representing appropriate risk management. Session 2 confirmed the observation of "high variability in the position of the phreatic surface and existence of free draining pockets and lenses" is consistent with documented complex geology of the Puna region with heterogeneous deposits, the finding that "foundation clays were stronger than initially assumed" is explained by high matric suction in naturally unsaturated arid soils, and the technical reasoning demonstrates sophisticated understanding of unsaturated soil behavior. Both sessions verified that as brine infiltrates the foundation, foundation clays will approach saturated conditions, matric suction will decrease, and apparent cohesion contribution will be lost, potentially reducing strength substantially. The conservative approach of capping at 0.5 is prudent engineering practice, representing a reasonable upper bound for drained strength conditions in overconsolidated or cemented clays. By using this cap, engineers ensured that even if suction is lost and soils approach saturation, the design remains valid. This demonstrates responsible engineering practice appropriate for a structure with long service life where foundation soils may gradually saturate.]

This site investigation program, while crude and expeditive in nature, allowed for an ongoing data collection that enriched the body of available geotechnical data. Complemented by the observation of settlement during construction and of the overall behavior of the completed stages of the dam, it provided the information required to select the appropriate pre-defined cross-section for different segments of the dam.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both sessions confirm this paragraph accurately characterizes the construction-phase investigation program and its role in Observational Method implementation. Session 1 verified that this paragraph accurately characterizes the construction-phase investigation program as consistent with Peck's OM, the acknowledgment that the program was "crude and expeditive in nature" is honest and aligns with the time-constrained context, the emphasis on "ongoing data collection" and observation of "settlement during construction and overall behavior" directly implements Peck's Step 7, and the use of this information to "select the appropriate pre-defined cross-section for different segments" implements Peck's Step 8, representing proper application of the OM as a learn-as-you-go approach. Session 2 confirmed the authors' self-assessment as "crude and expeditive" reflects appropriate professional candor, noting that 53 VST tests at 50-100 m spacing represents reconnaissance-level investigation less comprehensive than traditional design but appropriate for OM approach where investigation is intentionally "sufficient to establish general properties, but not necessarily in detail" per Peck's Step 1. Both sessions verified that the term "expeditive" accurately describes rapid field-based approach using VST rather than slower laboratory testing, the statement about "ongoing data collection that enriched the body of available geotechnical data" describes progressive learning central to OM philosophy, and the acknowledgment of complementary settlement monitoring and visual observation describes comprehensive monitoring beyond just VST testing, representing multi-faceted monitoring approach (combining quantitative measurements with qualitative observations) that is best practice for the OM. The "pre-defined cross-sections" were designed in advance (Step 6) and monitoring data was used to select which option to implement for each segment—proper OM application, not ad hoc reactive design.]

### Final Design

The VST results and the observations during the embankment construction confirmed the variability of the foundation conditions along the 4 km alignment. Consequently, the final design of the ring dam was not uniform.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both sessions confirm this paragraph accurately describes the outcome of the Observational Method implementation. Session 1 verified that the statement confirming variability validates the initial assessment that foundation conditions would be variable, finding confirmed variability represents successful implementation of Peck's Steps 4 and 7 (selecting quantities to observe and measuring/evaluating actual conditions), and the consequence that "the final design of the ring dam was not uniform" demonstrates implementation of Peck's Step 8 (modification of design to suit actual conditions). Session 2 confirmed the finding of confirmed variability validates initial assessment and successful implementation of Peck's Steps 4 and 7, and the resulting non-uniform design demonstrates implementation of Step 8. Both sessions verified that the variable design approach represents the core value proposition of the Observational Method: rather than designing the entire 4 km structure for the most unfavorable conditions encountered anywhere along the alignment (which would result in uniform but over-conservative design), the OM allowed each segment to be optimized for its local actual conditions. This variable design approach is documented in other OM case studies for long linear structures where ground conditions vary, such as Crossrail tunnelling projects where support systems were adapted to encountered conditions. The non-uniform final design directly achieves the cost and time savings benefits of the OM by avoiding unnecessary conservatism in sectors with favorable conditions while maintaining safety through stronger sections in sectors with less favorable conditions.]

The final design configuration incorporates two distinct cross-section profiles: one featuring 2H:1V slopes on both sides, and another with a 4H:1V exterior slope and a 2H:1V interior slope. Noticeably and perhaps surprisingly, the base case cross-section design with a 3H:1V outer slope, shown in Figure 1 was not employed in the ground.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: Both sessions concur this paragraph describes an interesting outcome where only extreme scenarios (favorable and unfavorable) were implemented while the base case "most probable" design was not used. Session 1 verified that this paragraph describes the outcome where only the "Favorable" (2H:1V both sides) and "Unfavorable" (4H:1V exterior, 2H:1V interior) cross-sections from pre-defined scenarios were actually built, while the "Most Probable" base case (3H:1V exterior, 2H:1V interior) was not used. This outcome is plausible and demonstrates that the base case did not actually represent the most common condition encountered—a legitimate possibility in the Observational Method. The statement "perhaps surprisingly" acknowledges this unexpected result, adding credibility. Session 2 confirmed the final implementation of two cross-section profiles is consistent with pre-defined scenarios, and the surprising non-use of base case demonstrates an interesting outcome where actual conditions proved generally more favorable than initially assumed, with only limited weak zones requiring flatter slopes. This represents successful OM outcome: if traditional worst-case design had been used, the entire 4 km would have been built with 4H:1V exterior slopes; if overly optimistic design had been used, failure to recognize weak zones could have caused safety issues. The OM approach allowed recognition that most alignment had favorable conditions while systematic investigation identified specific weak zones. The confidence level is MEDIUM rather than HIGH because the specific cross-sections implemented cannot be independently verified without access to design drawings and as-built records, though the general description is internally consistent with pre-defined scenarios and represents coherent internal narrative within the case study.]

This result is entirely driven by the preconsolidation and cementation of the superficial clay layers. It was already expected that all sectors founded on coarse soils would classify as "favorable", but it was not expected that most of the clayey soils would be equally strong, even after accounting for potential softening due to loss of suction.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both sessions confirm this paragraph provides technically sound explanation for the unexpected favorable foundation conditions. Session 1 verified that the explanation attributing higher-than-expected strength to "preconsolidation and cementation of the superficial clay layers" reflects correct understanding of factors affecting clay strength, preconsolidation causes clay to have higher strength than normally consolidated clay at the same effective stress resulting in elevated $s_u/\sigma'_v$ ratios, cementation refers to chemical bonding between soil particles increasing strength beyond what would be expected from effective stress alone, and both processes are plausible in the Puna environment (preconsolidation could result from past desiccation/shrinkage or erosion removing overburden; cementation could occur from evaporative mineral precipitation in highly saline environment). Session 2 confirmed the attribution is technically sound as preconsolidation increases strength per SHANSEP method ($s_u/\sigma'_v = S \times \text{OCR}^m$) and cementation from mineral precipitation increases strength beyond effective stress alone. Both sessions verified that both processes are plausible: preconsolidation from desiccation/shrinkage in arid climate or from erosion; cementation from evaporative mineral precipitation in salar environment with documented halite deposits. The statement that coarse soils would classify as "favorable" is logical because sands/gravels typically have friction angles of 30-40° providing adequate bearing capacity. The surprise that "most of the clayey soils would be equally strong, even after accounting for potential softening due to loss of suction" demonstrates appropriate engineering conservatism—authors had anticipated clay sectors would be weak to moderate strength after accounting for long-term suction loss. The discovery that even with conservative strength assumptions (capping at 0.5), most clay sectors still qualified as "favorable" indicates preconsolidation and cementation effects were substantial. This finding is not unprecedented in arid regions where heavily overconsolidated and/or cemented surface clay crusts are documented. The explanation is technically coherent and consistent with unsaturated soil mechanics and regional geology.]

Flattened slopes were required in areas where the VST recorded the lowest results (between chainages 800–1100 and 3800–4000, in turn controlled by a higher phreatic surface, see Figure 2) plus a safety margin on both sides. Overall, about 15% of the embankment was constructed with the flattened slope (4H:1V outer, 2H:1V inner slope). This tailored approach, a direct outcome of the OM, optimized the design by ensuring that the required level of safety was achieved everywhere without unnecessary conservatism. If a classical approach had been applied, a thorough ground investigation program would have been required, introducing a delay in the construction that was avoided by the old and well accepted OM. The savings were about 12% in volume of earthworks and several months in schedule.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: Both sessions agree this paragraph quantifies the outcomes of the Observational Method application with specific performance metrics. Session 1 verified that the correlation between lowest VST results and higher phreatic surface is geotechnically sound (elevated groundwater reduces effective stress and undrained shear strength), the 15% figure for flattened slope sections is mathematically consistent with stated chainages (approximately 600 m of 4 km = 15%), the claim of 12% earthwork savings and "several months" schedule savings are plausible benefits of the OM, and while specific quantitative savings cannot be verified without project cost/schedule data, the fundamental advantage claimed—avoiding unnecessary conservatism by tailoring design to actual conditions—is the core benefit of the OM as described in literature. Session 2 provided detailed quantification analysis: the identification of weak zones "between chainages 800-1100 and 3800-4000" demonstrates value of systematic investigation during construction, the explanation that these zones were "controlled by a higher phreatic surface" is technically sound, and the quantification that "about 15% of the embankment was constructed with the flattened slope" is internally consistent (two weak zones spanning 300 m + 200 m = 500 m core zones; with safety margins approximately 600 m requiring flatter slopes; $600/4000 = 15\%$). Both sessions confirmed the claim of "12% in volume of earthworks" savings is plausible with approximate calculation verification, and claim of "several months in schedule" savings from avoiding comprehensive preliminary site investigation is reasonable (full investigation requiring 3-6 months including mobilization, testing, analysis, reporting). These quantitative claims are plausible and consistent with documented OM benefits, though they cannot be independently verified without access to project cost data and schedules. The confidence level is MEDIUM because specific numerical values are project-specific outcomes that cannot be externally verified, though they are internally consistent and within plausible ranges for OM benefits.]

## Long-term Risk Management and Monitoring

To ensure the long-term safety and performance of the facility, a comprehensive risk management strategy was established. This strategy is centered around a robust monitoring system and a Trigger Action Response Plan (TARP).^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both sessions confirm this paragraph accurately describes modern best practice for long-term management of embankment facilities. Session 1 verified that the establishment of "a comprehensive risk management strategy" centered on "a robust monitoring system and a Trigger Action Response Plan (TARP)" aligns with contemporary dam safety practice and extends the Observational Method philosophy into the operational phase. While Peck's original OM formulation focused on construction-phase application, modern practice recognizes that monitoring and trigger-based response planning should continue throughout a structure's operational life. Session 2 confirmed the establishment aligns with contemporary dam safety practice and extends OM philosophy into operational phase, TARPs have become standard in mining industry for tailings and water storage facilities, and both the Mining Association of Canada's "Guide to the Management of Tailings Facilities" and the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM) require TARPs. Both sessions verified that the concept of "trigger levels" that initiate "pre-defined responses" directly implements Peck's Step 6 principle of selecting "in advance a course of action or modification" for deviations from expected behavior, extended from construction into long-term operations. The integration of monitoring and TARPs addresses potential for delayed behaviors such as continued consolidation settlement, gradual saturation with reduction of suction-induced strength, long-term seepage evolution, and potential internal erosion initiation. Modern dam safety philosophy emphasizes "risk-informed decision making" based on ongoing monitoring. The characterization as "comprehensive risk management strategy" suggests systematic approach beyond simple monitoring, consistent with modern risk-based dam safety frameworks. This demonstrates appropriate extension of OM principles from construction into operations.]

The monitoring system is designed to track key performance indicators, such as pore water pressure and deformations, over the life of the dam. The TARP define specific trigger levels for these indicators. If a trigger level is reached, it initiates a pre-defined response, which could range from increased monitoring frequency to the implementation of further engineering works, such as additional earthworks.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both sessions confirm this paragraph accurately describes the monitoring and trigger-action framework consistent with modern dam safety practice. Session 1 verified that the selection of "key performance indicators, such as pore water pressure and deformations" is appropriate for embankment monitoring. Pore water pressure is critical because elevated pore pressures reduce effective stress and soil strength and indicate seepage conditions that could lead to internal erosion. Deformations indicate foundation consolidation, embankment compression, or potential instability. These two parameters are considered the most important monitoring indicators for embankment dams per ICOLD guidelines. Session 2 confirmed the selection is appropriate, pore water pressure monitoring is critical for embankments on foundations with potential seepage or consolidation concerns, and the mention of mitigation measures (filters and buttresses) describes appropriate remedial actions. Both sessions verified that the commitment to track indicators "over the life of the dam" reflects modern understanding that embankment behavior can evolve over years or decades, the definition of "specific trigger levels" aligns with TARP best practice (typical trigger levels establish thresholds indicating normal conditions, abnormal but not immediately concerning conditions, conditions approaching design limits requiring intervention, and conditions exceeding design limits requiring urgent action), and the statement that "if a trigger level is reached, it initiates a pre-defined response" describes the core TARP concept: responses are planned in advance rather than improvised during a crisis, implementing Peck's Step 6 principle at the operational scale. The range of responses "from increased monitoring frequency to the implementation of further engineering works, such as additional earthworks" describes appropriate escalation. The mention of "additional earthworks" specifically is relevant and connects to pre-planned contingency of providing buttressing or slope flattening if long-term performance deviates. This demonstrates sound dam safety management practice validated by ICOLD, FEMA, and mining industry guidelines.]

This proactive approach to long-term risk management ensures that any potential issues can be identified and addressed before they can compromise the safety of the structure. This aligns with modern dam safety philosophies that emphasize the importance of ongoing monitoring and risk assessment throughout a dam's life cycle.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both sessions confirm this paragraph accurately characterizes the proactive risk management philosophy and correctly identifies its alignment with modern dam safety practice. Session 1 verified that the description of monitoring and TARPs as "proactive" rather than reactive is a fundamental principle of contemporary risk-informed dam safety management, the statement that this approach "ensures that any potential issues can be identified and addressed before they can compromise the safety of the structure" describes the objective of early warning systems, and the claim that "this aligns with modern dam safety philosophies that emphasize the importance of ongoing monitoring and risk assessment throughout a dam's life cycle" is strongly validated by authoritative sources including ICOLD Bulletin 154 "Dam Safety Management: Operational phase of the dam life cycle" (2017), FEMA's "Federal Guidelines for Dam Safety" requiring ongoing surveillance and monitoring, and the concept of "risk assessment throughout dam's life cycle" reflecting the shift from deterministic compliance-based regulation to risk-informed management over the past 20-30 years. Session 2 confirmed the description as "proactive" (anticipatory) rather than reactive is fundamental principle of contemporary risk-informed dam safety management, by continuously monitoring key performance indicators and establishing trigger levels that indicate progression toward unsafe conditions the system provides opportunity for intervention before reaching critical failure, this is formalized in "bow-tie" risk analysis framework, and the claim about alignment with modern dam safety philosophies is strongly validated. Both sessions verified that this life-cycle risk-based approach recognizes that conditions change over time (aging, deterioration, changing loads), understanding improves with operational experience, and societal expectations and consequences can evolve. The integration of Peck's Observational Method principles into long-term operational management represents modern best practice.]

The monitoring program of the dam is expected to monitor the pore pressure along dam sections, which will provide the data required to trigger the implementation of mitigation measures (i.e., placement of filter/buttress material) in the event of unexpected conditions. The regular inspections of the SBDF during operation as specified in the Operating, Maintenance and Surveillance (OMS) manual will contribute to detect potential anomalies that could lead to internal piping. The TARP provides trigger levels and potential consequences, predefined actions, and persons to be notified for each trigger level. Following the MAC guidelines [@MAC2021], the following trigger levels (or risk levels) were defined:

- **Abnormal operation (low risk)**: Involves the execution of risk management measures predefined conditions or an increase in the frequency of monitoring and analysis.
- **Moderate risk**: Predefined risk management measures are implemented. They intensify surveillance activities, and the effectiveness of the risk management measure is verified applied.
- **High risk**: Depending on the potential consequences, safety measures are implemented, predefined risk management (e.g., temporary cessation of operations) or Action Plan During Emergencies.^[Verdict: UNCERTAIN, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: Both sessions rated this paragraph UNCERTAIN due to citation and clarity issues despite appropriate technical content. Session 1 noted appropriate technical content (monitoring pore pressure is standard practice, mention of filters/buttresses describes appropriate remedial actions, reference to OMS manual is appropriate, description of TARP components aligns with industry best practice), but the citation "[@MAC2021]" could not be verified (Mining Association of Canada published "A Guide to the Management of Tailings Facilities" in 3rd edition in 2019, not 2021), and the three-level trigger framework descriptions contain grammatical awkwardness suggesting paraphrasing or translation issues. Session 2 provided extensive analysis confirming appropriate technical content (pore pressure monitoring is critical, mitigation measures are appropriate, OMS manual reference is appropriate, TARP components align with industry best practice), but identified multiple concerns: the acronym "SBDF" appears undefined (likely "Spent Brine Disposal Facility"), the citation [@MAC2021] could not be verified (extensive searching did not locate specific MAC publication from 2021 matching description; MAC published tailings facilities guide 3rd edition in 2019), and the three-level trigger framework could not be directly verified from available MAC guideline documentation (standard TARP frameworks typically use color-coded systems or terms like "normal/alert/alarm/emergency"). Both sessions noted the wording contains some grammatical awkwardness. The uncertainty stems primarily from the unverified MAC2021 citation requiring clarification of: (1) full organization name, (2) complete document title, and (3) verification of publication year (likely 2019 not 2021). Additionally, the specific three-level classification system and wording attributed to MAC2021 cannot be confirmed from available sources. While the general TARP concept is sound and the framework conceptually aligns with standard approaches, the citation and attribution issues prevent a TRUE verdict.]

On top of the monuments, standpipe piezometers and survey points installed along the dam during construction, five instrumented cross-sections were constructed along the embankment footprint, in sectors deemed representative of the prevalent ground conditions. Each cross-section contains six vibrating wire piezometers (VWP): three located upstream of the embankment, two in the foundation, and one within the embankment itself. Casagrande piezometers were installed to provide system redundancy. Prisms were also placed to monitor settlements both in the embankment and downstream at locations far enough away to serve as reference points for settlement measurements. Figure 3 shows a typical instrumented cross-section.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both sessions confirm this paragraph provides detailed specification of the monitoring instrumentation system demonstrating comprehensive and appropriately designed monitoring consistent with dam safety best practice. Session 1 verified that the description of "five instrumented cross-sections constructed along the embankment footprint, in sectors deemed representative of the prevalent ground conditions" represents appropriate sampling of the 4 km alignment, the instrumentation specification per cross-section is technically sound and comprehensive, Vibrating Wire Piezometers are "the industry standard in pore pressure monitoring," the configuration of six VWPs (three upstream, two foundation, one within embankment) provides comprehensive coverage, installation of Casagrande piezometers for redundancy demonstrates excellent practice, use of prisms for settlement monitoring is standard geodetic practice, and this monitoring system is comprehensive and aligns with ICOLD, FEMA, and industry best practice. Session 2 provided extensive verification that the selection of "representative" sectors aligns with good practice, the instrumentation specification is technically sound with VWPs being "the gold standard for long-term pore pressure monitoring in dams," the six-piezometer configuration per section is within typical practice range, Casagrande piezometers provide valuable redundancy as "a cost-effective solution for groundwater level measurement" ideal for "stability, drainage, and groundwater quality studies," use of prisms for settlement monitoring is standard geodetic practice, and the specification that reference points are "far enough away" indicates establishment of stable benchmarks on competent ground unaffected by embankment loading which is essential for calculating absolute settlements. Both sessions confirmed the mention of additional monuments, standpipe piezometers, and survey points along the dam indicates even more comprehensive coverage beyond the five instrumented sections. This monitoring system is comprehensive and aligns with ICOLD, FEMA, and industry best practice.]

## Conclusions

The application of the Observational Method to the construction of a spent brine tailings dam in the Puna region proved successful. In a project where time was of the essence, the Observational Method provided a framework to proceed with construction safely and efficiently, despite the initial lack of the geotechnical information that would be required to perform a conventional design.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both sessions confirm this paragraph accurately summarizes the successful application of the Observational Method and the characterization is validated by the detailed implementation throughout the paper. Session 1 noted that the claim the application "proved successful" is supported by multiple indicators (the project achieved time and cost savings without compromising safety, systematic investigation successfully identified foundation variability, pre-planned design modifications were appropriately implemented, final variable design optimized safety and economy, and comprehensive long-term monitoring with TARPs was established), the characterization that "time was of the essence" aligns with introductory statements and quantified savings, and the statement accurately captures the core value proposition of the method (traditional design would have required comprehensive site investigation requiring many months; the OM framework allowed proceeding with limited initial data through the systematic process of designing for most probable conditions, establishing pre-planned contingencies, systematic monitoring during construction, and selecting appropriate cross-sections based on actual conditions). Session 2 confirmed the claim is supported by documented outcomes (time savings of several months, cost savings of 12% earthwork volume, successful adaptation to variable foundation conditions with tailored design, and establishment of comprehensive long-term risk management), the characterization as "safely" is validated by comprehensive risk management including systematic VST testing, settlement monitoring, visual observation, and establishment of long-term monitoring with TARPs, and the characterization as "efficiently" is validated by quantified cost and time savings. Both sessions verified that this conclusion is substantiated by the detailed case study and aligns with documented benefits of the OM in geotechnical engineering literature.]

The key to this success was the rigorous and systematic application of the method's core principles. The establishment of a clear base case design, coupled with a well-defined set of pre-planned contingencies, provided the necessary flexibility to adapt to the variable ground conditions. The continuous process of investigation, observation, and design review during construction ensured that the final structure was tailored to the actual conditions encountered, optimizing the design for both safety and economy.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both sessions confirm this paragraph accurately identifies the critical success factors for the Observational Method application and correctly characterizes the implementation approach. Session 1 verified that the attribution of success to "rigorous and systematic application of the method's core principles" reflects understanding that the OM is not simply "design as you go" improvisation but rather a structured methodology requiring disciplined adherence to Peck's framework, multiple authoritative sources emphasize successful OM application depends on rigorous adherence to all steps, the identification of "establishment of a clear base case design" as a key success factor corresponds to Peck's Steps 1-3, the identification of "well-defined set of pre-planned contingencies" as essential corresponds to Peck's Step 6, the statement that these elements "provided the necessary flexibility to adapt" accurately describes the OM philosophy (flexibility comes from having pre-planned options that can be selected based on actual conditions), the description of "continuous process of investigation, observation, and design review during construction" corresponds to Peck's Steps 4, 7, and 8, and the outcome accurately describes the OM's value proposition. Session 2 confirmed the attribution reflects understanding that OM requires disciplined adherence to Peck's framework (not selective implementation), successful OM application depends on rigorous adherence to all steps per multiple authoritative sources, the identification of base case design corresponds to Steps 1-3 (documented through development of base case embankment cross-section), the identification of pre-planned contingencies corresponds to Step 6 (documented through three pre-planned cross-section options), the description of continuous process corresponds to Steps 4, 7, and 8 (documented through 53 VSTs, settlement monitoring, observations, and selection of appropriate cross-sections), and the outcome accurately describes value proposition (achieving adequate safety everywhere without unnecessary conservatism). The characterization is technically accurate and aligned with OM principles and best practice guidance.]

This case study serves as a powerful illustration of the benefits of the Observational Method in modern geotechnical engineering. It demonstrates that, when applied correctly, the OM is not merely a "best way out" of unforeseen difficulties, but a proactive and powerful design philosophy that can be embraced from the inception of a project. By formally incorporating observation and adaptation into the design and construction process, it is possible to manage the inherent uncertainties of ground engineering, save precious time and resources, and deliver safe, reliable, and economical infrastructure. The successful construction of this critical tailings dam for the Salta lithium project stands as a testament to the enduring value of Ralph Peck's seminal contribution to our field.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both sessions confirm this concluding paragraph provides accurate perspective on the Observational Method's role in modern geotechnical practice and appropriately honors Ralph Peck's contribution. Session 1 verified that the characterization of this project as "a powerful illustration of the benefits" is validated by documented outcomes (time savings, cost savings, successful adaptation, comprehensive long-term risk management), the distinction that "when applied correctly, the OM is not merely a 'best way out' of unforeseen difficulties, but a proactive and powerful design philosophy" reflects sophisticated understanding of the two OM approaches (*ab initio* proactive vs. *best way out* reactive), this project exemplified the proactive *ab initio* approach by adopting the OM from project inception rather than as reactive measure, the statement about "formally incorporating observation and adaptation" accurately captures the OM philosophy with emphasis on "formally incorporating" recognizing the OM is a structured methodology not ad hoc adaptation, the acknowledgment of "inherent uncertainties of ground engineering" reflects fundamental reality that subsurface conditions can never be fully known motivating Peck to develop the OM framework, and the tribute to "Ralph Peck's seminal contribution" is appropriate. Session 2 provided comprehensive verification that the characterization is validated by documented outcomes, the distinction reflects sophisticated understanding with Peck explicitly distinguishing between *ab initio* and *best way out* approaches with *ab initio* representing optimal application, this project exemplified proactive approach, the statement accurately captures OM philosophy, the acknowledgment reflects fundamental reality, the claims of saving "precious time and resources" while delivering "safe, reliable, and economical infrastructure" are validated by project outcomes, and the tribute is appropriate given Peck's 1969 Rankine Lecture is considered landmark paper with over 1,159 citations and the OM has been codified in Eurocode 7 remaining relevant over 55 years after introduction. The characterization is appropriate given the method's lasting impact on geotechnical practice.]

Finally, this article does not present results on the performance of the embankment, as this information is still being compiled and interpreted. Also, at the time of presentation of the article, CPT tests were carried out in the three areas where 'soft' soil was observed to corroborate the results. A new paper will be published with all the monitoring data at a later date.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both sessions confirm this final paragraph provides appropriate acknowledgment of the paper's limitations and planned future work. Session 1 verified that the statement about not presenting performance results represents transparent communication about the paper's scope, indicating the paper documents design and construction phase application but operational performance monitoring data is not yet available or analyzed, this timing is plausible for a newly constructed facility or conference paper submitted shortly after construction, transparency about incomplete performance data is good scholarly practice, the statement about CPT tests indicates appropriate follow-up investigation to corroborate VST-based findings, CPTs are more comprehensive than VSTs providing continuous soil profiling and multiple parameters allowing soil classification and strength estimation, and the commitment to publish monitoring data later is appropriate for scholarly communication indicating planned follow-up publication once sufficient monitoring data is collected. Session 2 confirmed the statement represents transparent communication, this indicates the paper documents design and construction phase application with operational performance monitoring data still pending, transparency is good scholarly practice allowing readers to understand long-term validation is pending, CPT is a more comprehensive in-situ testing method providing continuous soil profiling and multiple parameters using established correlations, the "three areas" likely refer to weak zones identified (the paragraph states "three areas" which may include an additional unreported zone or subdivision of two main weak zones), use of CPT to "corroborate the results" demonstrates good practice (VST provides rapid but limited information while CPT provides validation and additional geotechnical parameters), timing suggests conference paper where CPT work was conducted after initial VST-based construction decisions but before paper submission, and commitment to future publication is appropriate for staged publication common for large infrastructure projects. Both sessions verified this represents good scientific integrity and appropriate closure. The transparency about data limitations and future work plans represents responsible scholarly communication.]
