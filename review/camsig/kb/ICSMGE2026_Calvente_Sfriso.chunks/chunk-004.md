## The Observational Method: Principles and Advantages

The OM in geotechnical engineering can have two approaches [@Peck1969]; *ab initio* where the intention is to use the OM from the start of the project, and the *best way out* where construction has already started and some intervention is required to prevent a failure from occurring. In this study the *ab initio* approach was applied.

The application of the method, as outlined by [@Peck1969], involves the following key steps:

1. Sufficient site investigation to establish the general nature, pattern, and properties of the foundation, but not necessarily in detail.
2. Assessment of the most probable conditions and the most unfavorable conceivable deviations from these conditions.
3. Establishment of the design based on a working hypothesis of behavior under the most probable conditions.
4. Selection of quantities to be observed as construction proceeds and calculation of their anticipated values on the basis of the working hypothesis.
5. Calculation of values of the same quantities under the most unfavorable conditions compatible with the available data concerning the subsurface conditions.
6. Selection in advance of a course of action or modification of design for every foreseeable significant deviation of the observational findings from those predicted on the basis of the working hypothesis.
7. Measurement of the observed quantities and evaluation of actual conditions.
8. Modification of the design to suit actual conditions.

The primary advantage of the OM is that it can lead to significant cost and time savings by avoiding overly conservative designs based on worst-case scenarios that may be materialized only in a small part of the 4-kilometer-long dam. It is a powerful tool for managing risk, allowing the design to be adapted based on the actual performance of the structure. However, its successful application requires the following key aspects: (i) OM's application and probable design changes should be clearly communicated to all the stakeholders; (ii) commitment to comprehensive monitoring; and (iii) a plan of contingency actions shall be devised.
