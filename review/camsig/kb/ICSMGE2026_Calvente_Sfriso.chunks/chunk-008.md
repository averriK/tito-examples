## Conclusions

The application of the Observational Method to the construction of a spent brine tailings dam in the Puna region proved successful. In a project where time was of the essence, the Observational Method provided a framework to proceed with construction safely and efficiently, despite the initial lack of the geotechnical information that would be required to perform a conventional design.

The key to this success was the rigorous and systematic application of the method's core principles. The establishment of a clear base case design, coupled with a well-defined set of pre-planned contingencies, provided the necessary flexibility to adapt to the variable ground conditions. The continuous process of investigation, observation, and design review during construction ensured that the final structure was tailored to the actual conditions encountered, optimizing the design for both safety and economy.

This case study serves as a powerful illustration of the benefits of the Observational Method in modern geotechnical engineering. It demonstrates that, when applied correctly, the OM is not merely a "best way out" of unforeseen difficulties, but a proactive and powerful design philosophy that can be embraced from the inception of a project. By formally incorporating observation and adaptation into the design and construction process, it is possible to manage the inherent uncertainties of ground engineering, save precious time and resources, and deliver safe, reliable, and economical infrastructure. The successful construction of this critical tailings dam for the Salta lithium project stands as a testament to the enduring value of Ralph Peck's seminal contribution to our field.

Finally, this article does not present results on the performance of the embankment, as this information is still being compiled and interpreted. Also, at the time of presentation of the article, CPT tests were carried out in the three areas where 'soft' soil was observed to corroborate the results. A new paper will be published with all the monitoring data at a later date.
