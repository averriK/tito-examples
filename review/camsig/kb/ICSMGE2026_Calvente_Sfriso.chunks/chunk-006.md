## Implementation and Results

Trigger Action Response Plans were put in place to implement this OM design during the construction of the dam. For such a long structure, the construction phase ended up being a dynamic process involving continuous investigation, observation, and design adaptation.

### Construction Phase Geotechnical Investigations

As construction progressed, further geotechnical investigations were carried out along the axis of the embankment footprint wherever clays were found as the upper geotechnical unit. 53 in-situ vane shear tests (VST) [@ASTM2018] distributed at variable intervals between 50 m and 100 m were performed for a fast estimate of the undrained shear strength of the foundation soils.

While VST provided rapid strength assessment during construction, several limitations must be acknowledged when testing unsaturated soils with significant suction:

- The VST method was developed for saturated soils and may overestimate long-term strength in suction-enhanced soils due to apparent cohesion effects.
- Suction-induced strength is temporary and will decrease as the foundation soils approach saturation from brine infiltration.
- The test doesn't directly measure matric suction, making it difficult to separate the contributions of effective stress and suction to the measured strength.

Due to a high variability in the position of the phreatic surface and the existence of free draining pockets and lenses, the suction and preconsolidation pressure proved to be highly variable but, in most cases, the foundation clays were stronger than initially assumed. Given that this apparent high undrained shear strength is suction-induced, and that the spent brine will yield water to the foundation and reduce suction, a conservative approach was adopted, to cap the undrained shear strength ratio with a conservative estimate of drained strength $s_u/\sigma'_v = 0.5$. Therefore, all sectors deemed to be in "favorable" scenarios were designed with this capped shear strength ratio. VST results are shown in Figure 2.

This site investigation program, while crude and expeditive in nature, allowed for an ongoing data collection that enriched the body of available geotechnical data. Complemented by the observation of settlement during construction and of the overall behavior of the completed stages of the dam, it provided the information required to select the appropriate pre-defined cross-section for different segments of the dam.

### Final Design

The VST results and the observations during the embankment construction confirmed the variability of the foundation conditions along the 4 km alignment. Consequently, the final design of the ring dam was not uniform.

The final design configuration incorporates two distinct cross-section profiles: one featuring 2H:1V slopes on both sides, and another with a 4H:1V exterior slope and a 2H:1V interior slope. Noticeably and perhaps surprisingly, the base case cross-section design with a 3H:1V outer slope, shown in Figure 1 was not employed in the ground.

This result is entirely driven by the preconsolidation and cementation of the superficial clay layers. It was already expected that all sectors founded on coarse soils would classify as "favorable", but it was not expected that most of the clayey soils would be equally strong, even after accounting for potential softening due to loss of suction.

Flattened slopes were required in areas where the VST recorded the lowest results (between chainages 800–1100 and 3800–4000, in turn controlled by a higher phreatic surface, see Figure 2) plus a safety margin on both sides. Overall, about 15% of the embankment was constructed with the flattened slope (4H:1V outer, 2H:1V inner slope). This tailored approach, a direct outcome of the OM, optimized the design by ensuring that the required level of safety was achieved everywhere without unnecessary conservatism. If a classical approach had been applied, a thorough ground investigation program would have been required, introducing a delay in the construction that was avoided by the old and well accepted OM. The savings were about 12% in volume of earthworks and several months in schedule.
