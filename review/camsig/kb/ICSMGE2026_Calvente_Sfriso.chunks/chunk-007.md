## Long-term Risk Management and Monitoring

To ensure the long-term safety and performance of the facility, a comprehensive risk management strategy was established. This strategy is centered around a robust monitoring system and a Trigger Action Response Plan (TARP).

The monitoring system is designed to track key performance indicators, such as pore water pressure and deformations, over the life of the dam. The TARP define specific trigger levels for these indicators. If a trigger level is reached, it initiates a pre-defined response, which could range from increased monitoring frequency to the implementation of further engineering works, such as additional earthworks.

This proactive approach to long-term risk management ensures that any potential issues can be identified and addressed before they can compromise the safety of the structure. This aligns with modern dam safety philosophies that emphasize the importance of ongoing monitoring and risk assessment throughout a dam's life cycle.

The monitoring program of the dam is expected to monitor the pore pressure along dam sections, which will provide the data required to trigger the implementation of mitigation measures (i.e., placement of filter/buttress material) in the event of unexpected conditions. The regular inspections of the SBDF during operation as specified in the Operating, Maintenance and Surveillance (OMS) manual will contribute to detect potential anomalies that could lead to internal piping. The TARP provides trigger levels and potential consequences, predefined actions, and persons to be notified for each trigger level. Following the MAC guidelines [@MAC2021], the following trigger levels (or risk levels) were defined:

- **Abnormal operation (low risk)**: Involves the execution of risk management measures predefined conditions or an increase in the frequency of monitoring and analysis.
- **Moderate risk**: Predefined risk management measures are implemented. They intensify surveillance activities, and the effectiveness of the risk management measure is verified applied.
- **High risk**: Depending on the potential consequences, safety measures are implemented, predefined risk management (e.g., temporary cessation of operations) or Action Plan During Emergencies.

On top of the monuments, standpipe piezometers and survey points installed along the dam during construction, five instrumented cross-sections were constructed along the embankment footprint, in sectors deemed representative of the prevalent ground conditions. Each cross-section contains six vibrating wire piezometers (VWP): three located upstream of the embankment, two in the foundation, and one within the embankment itself. Casagrande piezometers were installed to provide system redundancy. Prisms were also placed to monitor settlements both in the embankment and downstream at locations far enough away to serve as reference points for settlement measurements. Figure 3 shows a typical instrumented cross-section.
