## Introduction

The process called Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) requires large facilities to dispose the spent brine after the extraction of the lithium from the brine solution using chemical or physical processes. This paper presents a case study on the construction of a circular ring dam with a diameter of about 1.3 km (a perimeter of 4 km) and an average height of 2.5 m for a spent brine storage facility at a lithium project located in the Puna region of Salta province in Argentina, an arid, high-altitude plateau with complex geological and geotechnical conditions.

The facility design was completed using a limited set of geotechnical data because of time constraints. To evaluate the potential changes on the design, a sensitivity assessment of the geotechnical foundation parameters was included in the scope. Based on this information the client decided to go ahead with the construction.

Designing with very limited information introduces considerable uncertainty, usually beyond what geotechnical engineers are comfortable with. To address these uncertainties in a manner that maintains both safety and cost-effectiveness, the Observational Method (OM) was adopted.

The Observational Method in geotechnical engineering, formally defined by Ralph Peck in his 1969 Rankine Lecture [@Peck1969], provides a structured approach to design and construction under high uncertainty. It allows for the design to be based on the most probable ground conditions, with pre-defined modifications to be implemented if observations during construction reveal different behaviors.

This "learn-as-you-go" approach is particularly well-suited for large-scale geotechnical projects like dams and tunnels, where ground conditions can be highly variable. This paper details the application of the OM to the embankment construction, demonstrating its effectiveness in accelerating project delivery without compromising safety.
