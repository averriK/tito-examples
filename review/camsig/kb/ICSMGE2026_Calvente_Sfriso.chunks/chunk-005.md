## Project Setting and Initial Design Strategy

### Geology and Ground Models

The geology of the Argentine Puna region is complex, characterized by volcanic and sedimentary deposits with significant variability in soil types and properties. To accommodate for this fact, a range of credible ground profiles was sketched, where various layers of halite deposits, fine sands, gravelly sands, colluvial silts and thin layers of clays were included, in a proportion similar to that of the geological and geotechnical data available.

Once the various scenarios of ground models were defined, the stability assessment of the embankment was undertaken using standard limit equilibrium analyses in Slide2 [@Rocscience2003]. Deterministic analyses for non-circular surfaces were performed to identify potential failure surfaces and the associated factor of safety (FoS) using the GLE/Morgenstern & Price and Spencer methods.

A steady state groundwater flow was computed to determine the pore pressure distribution along the embankment and foundation terrain. In every scenario, the free brine level upstream of the embankment was adopted 0.40 m above the crystallized halite and downstream was adopted 0.50 m below natural ground level as an upper bound of the water level reported on site.

### Base Case Design

A "base case" design was developed based on the most probable soil conditions identified during the initial site investigations.

Actions controlling design were:

- foundation settlement;
- wind and rain induced erosion of the exposed slopes; and
- internal piping.

The typical embankment cross-section is shown in Figure 1, featuring an interior slope of 2H:1V and an exterior slope of 3H:1V. The contained material is a high concentration brine which precipitates as a highly porous body of crystallized salt. This precipitate, deposited adjacent to the upstream wall of the embankment, reduces the geotechnical risk, a fact that supports the adoption of a steeper angle for the upstream slope. On the other side, water scarcity, environmental concerns and internal erosion resulted in the adoption of a geomembrane lining in all sectors where the upper foundation soils are not fine-grained materials. This design was the initial working hypothesis employed when the dam's construction started.

### Contingency Planning: Pre-defined Design Modifications

Recognizing the significant uncertainties in the foundation conditions, a key element of the OM was to establish a set of pre-defined design modifications. These modifications consisted of alternative embankment cross-sections, superficial ground treatment and liner design to be implemented if the observed soil conditions deviated from the "most probable" case.

In terms of embankment geometry, the controlling factor is the undrained shear strength ratio of the foundation soils ($s_u/\sigma'_v$). Three main scenarios were considered:

- **Favorable** ($s_u/\sigma'_v \geq 0.5$): A cross-section design with 2H:1V slopes on both sides would be used.
- **Most Probable** ($0.3 < s_u/\sigma'_v < 0.5$): Base case design's cross-section would be used (as per Figure 1).
- **Unfavorable** ($0.2 \leq s_u/\sigma'_v \leq 0.3$): The exterior slope would be further flattened to 4H:1V and an interior slope remaining at 2H:1V, but adopting a rate of construction compatible with the increase of shear strength of the foundation soils due to partial consolidation.
