ABSTRACT
 This paper presents seismic assessment of a 32 million gallon buried prestressed concrete res ervoir  owned and operated by the
Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) . The reservoir was designed for Seismic Zone 3 provisions  of the Uniform Building Code . The
design earthquake ground motions and detailing requ irements in the current codes are significantly hig her and more stringent
than those in the 1980s. The reservoir is located in an area of high seismic  hazard because of its proximity to the Cascadia
Subduction Zone (CSZ) and the Seattle Fault Zone (S FZ). The reservoir sustained minor to moderate damage in  the 2001
Nisqually earthquake with an increase in observed l eakage following the earthquake. Potential damage t o the reservoir in a
major earthquake is a significant concern for both post-earthquake water  needs and the potential risk of flooding of the
surrounding residential developments.  Buried reservoirs have a highly complex soil -structure interaction (SSI) response that
cannot be accurately captured using simplified proc edures.  A nonlinear SSI analysis was performed to assess th e risk of damage
to the reservoir.  The assessment was performed for multiple earthquake cases  to make prudent risk versus retrofit  cost decisions .

Introduction
The 32 million gallon (MG) Eastside reservoir is located in an area of high seismic hazard because of its
proximity to the Cascadia Subduction Zone ( CSZ) and the Seattle Fault Zone (SFZ)  as shown in Figure 1 .
There is evidence of numerous large -magnitude CSZ earthquakes with average recurrence interval between
300 to 500 years with t he most recent  earthquake on January 26, 1700 (323 years ago).  The estimated
probability of a major (M9) earthquake on CSZ is 7 to 12 percent in the next 50 years and 16 to 22 percent of
a smaller M8 to M9 earthquake.
 The reservoir site is located in open space in a 5.5 acre park with the surrounding neighborhood consist ing
of dense single -family housing developments . The reservoir sustained minor to moderate damage in the 2001
Nisqually earthquake with an increase in the amount of observed leakage increased following the earthquake.
Potential damage to the reservoir in a major earthquake is a significant conce rn for both post -earthquake water
needs and the potential risk of flooding of the surrounding residential developments.

Reservoir Description
The Eastside reservoir , constructed in 1986 , is a fully buried cast -in-place prestressed circular concrete tank
with an outside diameter of 352 feet  (Figure 2 a). It was  designed for Seismic Zone 3 provisions of the 1982
Uniform Building Code  [1]. The reservoir has a 10 -inch thick roof slab  supported by the exterior reservoir wall
and interior concrete columns  (Figure 2b). The tapered exterior wall is prestressed in the hoop direction by
cables and in the vertical direction  by prestressing rods.  Seismic cables (Figure 3) are the only positive
connection between the wall and its foundation , allow ing movement in the radial direction but restraint in the
tangential direction.  The reservoir floor slab is cone-shaped and provides an additional 20 feet of water depth
near the center of the structure. The maximum fill -height of the reservoir along the perimeter wall is 33.5 feet.
The roof -to-wall connection  is through shear keys (Figure 4). Neoprene pad s between the roof slab and the
wall allow  movement in the radial direction . A shift of as much as 1.5 inches in the shear keys between the
wall and the roof was observed at multiple locations. Th is movement could have been a result of the 2001
Nisqually earthquake but it cannot be confirmed.

Seismic Hazard
Geotechnical investigations show the site to be underlain by medium dense to  very dense fill over glacial till.
The glacial till is likely underlain by sandstone and siltstone but the borings do not show  a consistent pattern
throughout the site.  The geophysical investigations show site Vs30 to range between 1,351 ft/s to 1,157 ft/s.
The reservoir site is underlain by the Seattle Basin with the depth to basement rock over 7,000 meters. Ground
motions considering basin effects and measured Vs30 were computed for eight earthquake cases includin g M9
and M7 on CSZ, M7 on SFZ and probabilistic ground motions for 72, 100, 475, 975, and 2,475 -year return

periods . For nonlinear SSI analysis acceleration time histories were selected by developi ng the conditional
mean spectrum as described in Baker and Cornell  [2] and Baker [ 3].

Soil-Structure Interaction Analysis
SSI analysis was performed using LS-Dyna with the schematic of the model shown in Figure 5.

The reservoir wall, base slab, and roof slab was modeled with shell elements  and interior columns with beam
element s. Elastic material model for concrete was used bec ause no significant material nonlinearity is expect ed
due to the existing prestressing. Contact elements to allow for uncoupled behavior between the roof and the
wall and between the wall and the foundations were used.  Mass of the water inside the reservoir was modeled
as impulsive and convective components  per ACI 350.3 -06 [ 4]. The impulsive mass was rigidly attached to
the reservoir wall. Force associated with the conve ctive mass was applied as a static load in the dire ction of
maximum response ; a reasonable assumption because of the very long calculated sloshing period.
 S oil around and below the reservoir was modeled with solid elements. Separate hysteretic soil material
models were used to model till, fill and the drainage material around the reservoir. Input parameters included
mass density; bulk modulus at the reference pressure; and cut -off pressure . Custom curves defining shear stress

versus shear strain were defined for each material . The nonlinear material model  was validated using simple
finite element models  of a retaining wall  and comparing the calculate d passive soil pressure with theoretical
value s. The interface between the soil and the structure was modeled with interface elements  that do not
transfer tension and allow separation of soil from the structure during intense shaking.
 To avoid reflection of pressure waves from the perimeter of the finite element model, nonref lecting
boundary condition was specified at the model perimeter. Earthquake ground motion time histories selected
for the project are applied at the base of the model  and propagated through vertical soil columns along the
edges of the model. The vertical soil column along the edges was modeled with its size much larger than the
reservoir diameter. Nodal constraints were  applied at the nodes of the soil mesh boundary to enable 1 -D like
soil behavior to represent free -field motion. The analysis includes radiation damping in the soil.

Assessment Results
The results of the analysis showed a generally good performance of the reservoirs with three significant
vulnerabilities. F or 975 -year return period and higher ground motions hoop stress  in the upper 3 to 4 feet of
the reservoir wall exceed capacity and there is a potential for several inches of sliding at the wall base (Figure
6). The assessment a lso showed potential risk of cracking the shear key  corner s due to brittle reinforcing detail .
Although costly to repair, the risk of major damage and loss of water for this vulnerability is low.

Conclusions
The complex soil -structure interaction (SSI) response of buried reservoir cannot be accurately captured using
traditional analysis . There are many factors that can only be modeled through an SSI analysis  including
nonlinear response of the soil, poorly compacted soil close to the reservoir wall, variation of passive soil along
the wall height , radiation damping, and radial movement of roof and base slab . The SSI analysis for a range of
ground motion s provided a complete risk picture. Additional simplified analyses were performed to study the
impact of analysis assumptions and to evaluate operational changes such as reduc tion in water height or the
removal of soil cover from the roof on the identified vulnerabilities.
