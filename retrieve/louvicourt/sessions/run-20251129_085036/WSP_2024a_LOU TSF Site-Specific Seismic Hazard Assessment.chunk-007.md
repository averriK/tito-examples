# 7.0 SEISMIC HAZARD RESULTS

The PSHA calculations were carried out using the software OpenQuake v3.16.3 for the Louvicourt TSF site located at 48.135°N latitude and 77.595°W longitude and for a VS30 of 1,853 m/s to represent the site ground conditions of the local bedrock. Analyses were completed for a minimum earthquake magnitude of Mw 4.8 (the same minimum magnitude used in CanadaSHM6) and for a maximum of five standard deviations above and below the mean (i.e., epsilon ±5).

## 7.1 Probabilistic Results

This section describes the results from the PSHA, including hazard curves, mean uniform hazard spectra, and disaggregation results for selected spectral periods.

### 7.1.1 Site-Specific Hazard Curves

Figure 8 shows mean hazard curves for PGA and spectral periods (5%-damped) of 0.2 s, 0.5 s, 1.0 s, and 2.0 s for annual exceedance probabilities ranging from 0.1 to 0.0001 or approximately equivalent return periods of 10 to 10,000 years. The hazard curves were developed for an estimated VS30 of 1,853 m/s for the bedrock ground conditions at the Louvicourt TSF site. The hazard curves indicate that the mean 1/2,475 AEP, 1/5,000 AEP, and 1/10,000 AEP PGAs are 0.099 g, 0.140 g, and 0.193 g, respectively.

The uncertainties associated with each hazard curve are presented as fractiles along with mean hazard curves in Figure 9. Hazard curve plots include the median (50th fractile) with one standard deviation (16th and 84th fractiles) and two standard deviations (5th and 95th fractiles) to indicate uncertainty in the mean value.

Figure 10 shows hazard curves calculated for different seismic sources. These plots show the dominant contributing sources to the total seismic hazard at different AEPs and spectral periods. The 10 sources with the largest contribution to seismic hazard at the site are shown on each plot, and the summation of all other sources is also shown. The largest hazard contribution is associated with the Charlevoix (CHV) seismic source zone in the H2 (Historical) sub-model of CanadaSHM6. The CHVHY source, which is the equivalent Charlevoix source zone in the HY (Hybrid) sub-model, is the second largest contributor, with the Gatineau (GAT) source zone the third largest contributor.

### 7.1.2 Uniform Hazard Spectra

Figure 11 shows mean site-specific UHS for the 1/2,475, 1/5,000, and 1/10,000 AEPs for a VS30 of 1,853 m/s. The definition of the UHS is described in detail in Section 1.3.

Figure 12, Figure 13, and Figure 14 show the mean UHS along with the 5th, 16th, 50th (median), 84th, and 95th fractiles for 1/2,475 AEP, 1/5,000 AEP, and 1/10,000 AEP, respectively. Table 3, Table 4, and Table 5 list the spectral ordinates for the UHS and fractiles for 1/2,475 AEP, 1/5,000 AEP, and 1/10,000 AEP, respectively.

We note that the mean and fractile UHS exhibit a small 'bump' at approximately 0.1 s spectral period. This is attributed primarily to the shape of the ground motion models applied in this assessment, and also partly to the varying contribution of different seismic source zones to the hazard at the Louvicourt TSF site at shorter and longer spectral periods.

### 7.1.3 Disaggregation of Seismic Hazard

Magnitude-distance disaggregation is commonly used to identify the seismic sources that are the most significant contributors to the total probabilistic hazard at specific spectral periods and likelihoods. In addition to the hazard curves by source (e.g., Figure 10) that show the combined effect of earthquake likelihood, magnitude and source-to-site distance from each seismic source, WSP disaggregated the hazard by earthquake magnitude and source-to-site distance. The magnitude-distance disaggregation is a joint probability mass distribution that describes the contribution from all seismic sources based on the magnitude and source to site distance at selected combinations of spectral period and likelihood. The magnitude-distance disaggregations in this assessment are enhanced by also plotting the distribution of epsilon for each combination of distance and magnitude. Epsilon is the number of standard deviations by which a ground motion from a given source at a given magnitude-distance combination is above or below the median predicted by the ground motion models.

Disaggregation plots for PGA and spectral periods of 0.2 s, 0.5 s, and 1.0 s for AEPs at 1/2,475, 1/5,000, and 1/10,000 are presented in Figure 15, Figure 16, and Figure 17, respectively.

The mean and mode of the magnitude-distance joint probability mass distribution supports the selection of scenario earthquake used in earthquake acceleration time history development. Table 6 lists the mean, median, and mode of the magnitude, distance, and epsilon values, for each couplet of selected AEPs and at selected spectral periods.

### 7.1.4 Comparison with CanadaSHM6

WSP completed this SSSHA with the CanadaSHM6 seismic source model and weights without modification from those published by [@Kolaj2023]. We have applied these source models with the most recent version of the NGA-East GMMs described [@Goulet2018]. The suite of GMMs originally implemented with the CanadaSHM6 source models to calculate seismic hazard values for the 2020 NBCC is a different combination of GMMs to those applied in this assessment. The results of this assessment, therefore, differ from the results presented as part of the 2020 NBCC.

Table 7 shows accelerations for selected spectral accelerations calculated using OpenQuake for AEPs of 1/475 and 1/2,475, for a site ground condition of VS30 = 1,853 m/s. We note that the 2020 NBCC does not provide results at AEPs of 1/5,000 and 1/10,000, so a comparison of results for these likelihoods is not presented. The results of this assessment are up to 43% greater than those from the 2020 NBCC. The increase is mostly caused by our use of the 17 NGA-East GMMs and the [@Stewart2020] and [@Hashash2020] site amplification factors in this assessment.

While there are moderate to large percentage differences between this assessment and the 2020 NBCC, the absolute differences in earthquake accelerations are relatively small. That is, the hazard at the Louvicourt TSF site remains relatively low when compared to other parts of southeast Canada and more active regions in western Canada. The differences are because of evolving GMM development and uncertainties associated with the appropriate sigma models. WSP considers that the acceleration values provided in this assessment are the best available estimate at this time, but changes can be expected in the future as the GMMs and site amplification factors continue to be refined.
