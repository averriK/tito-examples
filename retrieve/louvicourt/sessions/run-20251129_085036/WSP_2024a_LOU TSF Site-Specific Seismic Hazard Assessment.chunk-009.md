# 9.0 CONCLUSIONS

WSP evaluated the site-specific seismic hazard at the Louvicourt TSF site through probabilistic analysis for AEPs of 1/2,475, 1/5,000, and 1/10,000. We implemented the CanadaSHM6 seismic source models for southeastern Canada along with the 17 NGA-East GMMs, AA13 standard deviation model, and equally weighted site amplification models developed for the CENA region. Results are presented for the Louvicourt TSF site measured seismic ground condition with a VS30 = 1,853 m/s.

The results of the probabilistic analysis indicate that:

- The site is within a region of generally low historical earthquake activity in southwestern Québec, to the west of the more historically seismically active St. Lawrence and Ottawa-Gatineau areas (Figure 1).

- The seismic hazard at the Louvicourt TSF site is relatively low compared to other parts of southeast Canada. For example, the 1/10,000 AEP mean horizontal spectral accelerations (5%-damped) are 0.193 g, 0.350 g, and 0.122 g for PGA, 0.2 s, and 1.0 s spectral periods, respectively (Figure 14).

- The dominant contributors to the seismic hazard across all spectral periods evaluated are moderate- to large-magnitude earthquakes (~Mw 6.8 to Mw 7.4) at distances of about 100 km to 200 km from the Louvicourt TSF site (Figure 15, Figure 16, Figure 17, and Table 6).

- There are some smaller contributions to the seismic hazard from moderate-magnitude earthquakes (typically Mw <6.0) within about 40 km of the site, particularly at short spectral periods (PGA and 0.2 s), and from moderate- to large-magnitude earthquakes (Mw 6.8 to Mw 7.4) at greater source-to-site distances (about 360 km and greater).

- The seismic hazard estimate for the Louvicourt TSF site from this SSSHA is higher than indicated in the 2020 NBCC (at 1/2,475 AEP) by up to 43%. The primary reason for the higher estimate is our application of more recent GMMs and site amplification models than those used for the 2020 NBCC.

The uncertainties associated with the mean hazard values are relatively large. For example, the average ratio of 95th-fractile to 5th-fractile PGA is about 5 for this site for the AEPs analyzed. The major contributors to the uncertainty in the probabilistic seismic hazard analysis are the:

- Relatively low occurrence rates of historical and instrumental earthquakes in the region surrounding the site.

- Lack of recorded earthquakes near the site to constrain earthquake recurrence parameters.

- Epistemic uncertainties in the NGA-East GMM weighted logic-tree framework.

- Aleatory uncertainty in the AA13 standard deviation (sigma) models.

The sources of uncertainty listed above cannot be reduced because they rely upon the occurrence of more earthquakes in a region of relatively low activity.

Two suites of eight, two-horizontal-component earthquake acceleration time histories (EATHs) are amplitude-scaled to match the 1/10,000 AEP mean UHS for one short fundamental period, TS = 0.25 to 0.37 s, and one long fundamental period, TL = 1.15 s, respectively. The EATHs were selected using causal parameters indicated by the disaggregation analysis, with additional consideration of secondary IMs. Candidate records were selected from the NGA-West2 database, due to a lack of records with the required causal parameters in other databases (i.e., NGA-East).

The results of the earthquake acceleration time history development indicate that:

- The geometric mean spectrum of the eight selected EATHs for each period range is generally within about 90% to 130% of the 1/10,000 AEP mean UHS.

- The secondary IMs of selected EATHs generally provide a good fit to conditional secondary IMs calculated using an earthquake scenario based on causal parameters indicated by the disaggregation analysis.

- Several of the selected EATHs have shorter source-to-site distances than indicated by the disaggregation analysis. Records with shorter source-to-site distances are required to capture the high-frequency (short-period) ground motions indicated by the 1/10,000 AEP UHS at the Louvicourt TSF site. These shorter distance records provide a good match to the target spectrum and secondary IMs and are, therefore, considered acceptable for geotechnical analysis.
