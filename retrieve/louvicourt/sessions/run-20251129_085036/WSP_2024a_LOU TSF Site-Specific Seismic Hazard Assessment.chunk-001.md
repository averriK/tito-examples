## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents the results of a site-specific seismic hazard assessment (SSSHA) undertaken by WSP Canada (WSP) for the tailings storage facility (TSF) at Teck's closed Louvicourt Mine site in southwestern Québec. The assessment is for Dam 1D of the Louvicourt TSF (48.135ºN latitude and 77.595ºW longitude). Dam 1D was selected for the SSSHA because it is likely the critical structure for the overall stability of the TSF. The SSSHA includes probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) used to estimate earthquake ground motions with annual exceedance probabilities (AEPs) of 1/2,475, 1/5,000, and 1/10,000. The SSSHA also provides earthquake acceleration time histories (EATHs) amplitude-scaled to the 1/10,000 AEP site-specific mean uniform hazard spectrum (UHS) from the PSHA.

The Louvicourt SSSHA is based on seismic source models developed for southeastern Canada by the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) for the 6th Generation Seismic Hazard Model of Canada (CanadaSHM6). The tectonic setting, seismicity rates, and earthquake distribution within about 600 km of the Louvicourt TSF site were reviewed to confirm the suitability of the CanadaSHM6 seismic source models for the SSSHA. Earthquake ground motions were evaluated by applying the 17 NGA-East ground motion models (GMMs) and 2020 site amplification models developed for central and eastern North America (CENA). These GMMs and site amplification models supersede those used by GSC with the CanadaSHM6 source models. Site amplification was based on the measured time-averaged shear-wave velocity over 30 m below the bedrock ($V_{S30}$) of 1,853 m/s.

Table S1 lists the mean and selected fractile uniform hazard spectral ordinates developed from the site-specific PSHA at AEPs of 1/2,475, 1/5,000, and 1/10,000:

The site-specific PSHA results are higher than those reported in the 2020 National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) for the same site, ground conditions and the $V_{S30}$ of 1,853 m/s. These differences are primarily because of our use of the 17 NGA East GMMs and recent site amplification models.

The site-specific PSHA results, including UHS and magnitude-distance-epsilon disaggregation, inform the development of representative EATHs for use in future geotechnical analyses. WSP developed EATHs at two fundamental periods important to the Louvicourt TSF site – a shorter fundamental period, $T_S$ = 0.25 to 0.37 s, and a longer fundamental period, $T_L$ = 1.15 s. Eight, two-horizontal-component EATHs from the NGA-West2 ground motion database were amplitude-scaled to match the 1/10,000 mean UHS within a period range of interest specific to each of the fundamental periods. Secondary intensity measures (IMs) were considered to establish the suitability of the selected EATHs.

¹ "5%-damped" refers to the fact that the UHS describes the estimated elastic-response of inverted pendula to an earthquake ground motion with an assumed 5% damping of the response applied to represent the loss of energy in transmission. 5%-damping is the typical value used for earthquake ground motions and is incorporated in the GMMs implemented in this study. See Section 1.3 for further details.

## 1.0 INTRODUCTION

This report describes the data, methods, technical developments, and results of site-specific seismic hazard assessment (SSSHA) undertaken for Teck Resources Ltd's closed tailings storage facility (TSF) at Louvicourt Mine near Val d'Or, Québec, Canada (Figure 1). For the purposes of this assessment, seismic analysis was completed by WSP Canada Limited (WSP) for a site at 48.135ºN latitude and 77.595ºW longitude ('the Louvicourt TSF site'). This location corresponds to Dam 1D of the TSF. Dam 1D was selected for the SSSHA because this is understood to be the critical structure for the overall stability of the TSF.

The SSSHA was undertaken for Teck Resources Ltd (Teck) as part of the work scope described in Teck's change order CO-03 dated September 15, 2023, and associated purchase order PO-353 dated April 29, 2022.

### 1.1 Scope of Work

The purpose of this SSSHA is to quantify earthquake ground motions with an annual exceedance probability (AEP) of 1/2,475, 1/5,000, and 1/10,000. These AEPs are approximately equivalent to return periods of 2,475-, 5,000-, and 1/10,000-years, respectively.

WSP undertook the following major tasks for the SSSHA:

- Acquisition and review of available information on historical earthquakes, regional tectonics, and potential faults within about 600 km of the Louvicourt TSF site.

- Review of seismic source models developed by the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) and Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) for the 2020 National Building Code of Canada (2020 NBCC).

- Development of logic trees to capture epistemic uncertainty in the site-specific seismic source model inputs and ground motion models (GMMs).

- Completion of site-specific probabilistic seismic hazard analyses (PSHA) to produce mean and fractile hazard curves for selected spectral periods (peak ground acceleration [PGA], 0.2 seconds [s], 0.5 s, 1.0 s, and 2.0 s), and uniform hazard spectra (UHS) for selected AEPs (1/2,475, 1/5,000, and 1/10,000).

- Magnitude-distance-epsilon deaggregation of site-specific seismic hazard to identify the earthquake magnitudes and distances that make the greater contribution to the site hazard for the 1/10,000 AEP at PGA, 0.2 s, 0.5 s, and 1.0 s.

- Development of eight, two-horizontal-component earthquake acceleration-time histories (EATHs), matched to the 1/10,000 AEP uniform hazard spectral accelerations to support dynamic stability, settlement, and liquefaction analyses at the site, as needed by the project engineers.

- Preparation of this report for Teck's review and comment.

### 1.2 Terminology

The terminology used in PSHA is specialized. The use of synonymous terms can often lead to confusion. Table 1 lists key terms and alternative, similar terms that relate technical terms used in this report to other commonly used terms. A glossary of abbreviations found in this report can be found in Appendix A.

**Table 1: Terminology Used in this Report.**

| Technical Term and Units | Alternative Similar Terms (units and definition may vary) |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Spectral period (seconds, s) | Period, natural-period, period-of-vibration, natural frequency |
| Acceleration¹ (percentage of gravitational acceleration, g) | Peak horizontal acceleration, spectral acceleration |
| Annual exceedance probability (AEP) | Return period² (years), frequency, annual probability of exceedance (APE) |
| Uniform hazard spectrum (UHS) | Uniform hazard curve, acceleration response spectrum, response spectrum, spectral response spectrum, uniform hazard acceleration response spectrum, uniform hazard mean acceleration response spectrum |
| Ground Motion Model (GMM) | Ground motion prediction equation (GMPE), attenuation equation |
| Disaggregation | Deaggregation, de-aggregation |
| Areal Sources | Areal seismic sources, background sources, area sources. This term describes all sources that are not known or associated with mapped faults. Areal sources can be subdivided into gridded-area and uniform-area sources. |

**Notes:**

1. The term 'acceleration' used in this report is the mean RotD50 horizontal peak acceleration response of a 5%-damped, single-degree-of-freedom system.

2. Return period is the inverse of annual exceedance probability (AEP).
