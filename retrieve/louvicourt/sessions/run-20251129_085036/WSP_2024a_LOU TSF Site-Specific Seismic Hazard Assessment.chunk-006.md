# 6.0 SOURCE MODEL AND GMM UNCERTAINTY

Epistemic uncertainty is the uncertainty associated with the simplified and imprecisely known scientific model of a natural process. This uncertainty is typically parameterized by considering alternative model input parameters to the PSHA (e.g., [@Abrahamson2006], [@Abrahamson2009]). The input model parameters include the seismic source models, their recurrence parameters and maximum earthquake magnitudes, hypocentral depth, and the ground motion models. Epistemic uncertainty is commonly accommodated through a logic-tree approach.

For this assessment, WSP has adopted the input parameters, logic tree, and weighting values implemented for CanadaSHM6. In CanadaSHM6, the two magnitude-frequency distribution (MFD) branches of the logic tree, comprising three alternative recurrence parameter (a- and b-values) branches and three alternative Mmax branches, were collapsed into a single MFD branch for computational efficiency. While collapsing these two branches in the logic tree had a negligible impact on median hazard values produced using CanadaSHM6, it limits the ability to perform a detailed analysis of the fractiles or model input sensitivity tests.

Figure 7 shows the logic tree implemented in this assessment. Parameters and weights for the CanadaSHM6 seismic source models are taken from [@Kolaj2023]. Period- and model-dependent weights for the final suite of 17 NGA-East GMMs are implemented as recommended by [@Goulet2018].
