6. The selected suite of ground motions was accepted once the geometric mean of the horizontal components
   agreed with the target spectrum within the period range of interest and the empirical IMs compared
   reasonably well with the conditional IM values.

8.1        Ground Motion Selection Criteria
Ground motion selection criteria used in EATH development are presented in this section.

▪   Target spectrum: The mean UHS for the 1/10,000 AEP.

▪   Conditioning period, T*: For the short fundamental period, TS* was taken as 0.31 s (i.e., the centre of the
    range 0.25 s to 0.37 s). For the long fundamental period, TL* was taken as 1.15 s.

▪   Period range of interest: For the short fundamental period, a period range of interest of 0.062 s to 0.62 s
    (i.e., 0.2TS* to 2.0TS*) for scaling of candidate ground motions. For the longer fundamental period, a period
    range of interest of 0.23 s to 2.3 s (i.e., 0.2TL* to 2.0TL*) was adopted for scaling of candidate ground motions.

▪   Causal parameters: The magnitude and distance used for motion selection and estimation of IMs were
    selected based on the disaggregation results presented in Section 7.1.3. Figure 17 shows that the largest
    contribution to the 1/10,000 AEP seismic hazard at the Louvicourt TSF site is from earthquakes with
    magnitudes of about Mw 6.8 to Mw 7.5 and source-to-site distances of about 100 to 200 km, for both the
    shorter spectral periods (e.g., 0.2 s) and longer spectral periods (e.g., 1.0 s). Table 6 shows that mean,
    median, and mode values for the magnitude and distance generally agree at the shorter and longer spectral
    periods as well. Based on these results, ground motions were selected based on the modal disaggregation
    scenario of Mw 7.3 and 170 km source-to-site distance.

▪   Secondary IMs:

      ▪ Median and lognormal standard deviation (σ) of the secondary IMs were estimated for the causal
          parameters listed above using the ground motions models listed in Table 8 and Table 9.

      ▪ AI and CAV were conditioned to the 1/10,000 AEP hazard at each of TS* and TL* following the approach
          described by Baker et al. (2021). Conditioning involves the use of epsilon (), which is the number of
          standard deviations for the spectral acceleration at T* to be equal to the hazard level. The  was
          estimated to be 1.5 for both the short and long fundamental periods, based on the 1/10,000 AEP hazard
          disaggregations (Table 6).

      ▪ The shaking duration IMs of D5-75 and D5-95 were not conditioned for each of the TS* and TL* because
          they are period-independent IMs.

      ▪ Table 8 lists the conditional median values of AI and CAV. The unconditional median values of D 5-75 and
          D5-95 are listed in Table 9. Figure 20 and Figure 21 show the distributions of all secondary IMs.

8.2        Candidate Ground Motion Records
The PEER NGA-West2 database was used to create a catalogue of prospective ground motions ranging in
magnitude from Mw 6.0 to Mw 7.8 and source-to-site distance from 0 to 200 km for each period range of interest,
consistent with the disaggregation results. The PEER NGA-East database was also consulted but lacked ground
motions records with magnitudes greater than Mw 5.85. Relatively loose bounds were used for earthquake
magnitude and distance because the ground motion selection process explicitly considered secondary IMs. By
explicitly considering the secondary IMs, it is less important to target specific causal parameters such as
earthquake magnitude (e.g., Baker et al., 2021). The site parameters, therefore, were not limited in creating the
prospective ground motion catalogues to increase the number of prospective motions in the catalogue. Similarly,
while scale factors applied to prospective ground motions were generally kept within the range 0.5 to 4.0, the
scale factor was considered less important than the comparison of secondary IMs and the fit of selected ground
motions to the target spectrum.

8.3        Ground Motion Selection Results
Table 10 and Table 11 list the key parameters of the two suites of eight, two-horizontal-component time histories
selected for TS and TL, respectively.

Figure 18 and Figure 19 show the geometric means of the suites of selected scaled ground motions compared to
the target 1/10/000 AEP UHS, respectively. The figures show that the geometric mean of each suite of ground
motions agrees well with the target spectra because it falls between 90% and 130% of the target spectra within
the period range of interest.

Table 12 and Table 13 list selected intensity measures for each component for the suites of motions selected for
TS and TL, respectively. The intensity measures of the suites of selected motions generally agree with the
theoretical values listed in Table 8 and Table 9. Figure 20 and Figure 21 show the cumulative probability of


                                                                                                                  39
January 15, 2024                                                                              006-21494974.5000-Rev0




empirical and estimated conditional intensity measures for AI, CAV, D5-75, and D5-95. Figure 20 and Figure 21
show that the IMs of the selected motions are generally well matched to their theoretical values. However, the IMs
of the scaled motions appear higher relative to the target IMs (i.e., average values of scaled IMs are slightly
greater than the median of the respective target IMs).

As discussed in Section 8.1, the ground motion selection process focused on selecting motions that matched the
target spectrum and generally agreed with estimated conditional IMs. Consequently, the selected suites of ground
motions for TS and TL include records with shorter source-to-site distances than suggested by the magnitude-
distance-epsilon disaggregation results presented in Section 7.1.3. The shorter source-to-site distances allowed a
better fit to the target spectrum, while still agreeing with the estimated conditional IMs. The selection of records
with shorter source-to-site distances is commonly used when applying earthquake ground motions from plate
boundary areas to intraplate stable continental regions such as that surrounding the Louvicourt TSF site in
southeast Canada.

A major reason why the source-to-site distances of selected records are shorter than the disaggregation results is
in part because of the difference between the Louvicourt TSF site condition (VS30 = 1,853 m/s) and the relatively
less stiff plate boundary ground conditions where the prospective ground motions were recorded. Moderate- to
high-frequency ground motions are attenuated faster by weaker seismic ground conditions (i.e., lower VS30)
compared to stiffer ground conditions. Additionally, moderate- to high-frequency ground motions are attenuated
faster than lower frequency ground motions. To capture the high-frequency (short-period) ground motions
indicated by the 1/10,000 AEP UHS at the Louvicourt TSF site, records with shorter source-to-site distances were
required. Some records with larger scale factors were also required to obtain a good match to the target spectrum
in the shorter period range of interest (notably, RSNs 1833 and 2927 in Table 10). We anticipate that suitable
candidate ground motions from intraplate conditions would have source-to-site distances that are more consistent
with the disaggregation results. Regardless, the selected motions have engineering IMs that are consistent with
the hazard based on intraplate conditions, so we consider that they are suitable for engineering analyses at the
Louvicourt TSF site.

Appendix A and Appendix B present the selected, scaled EATHs for the short and long period range of interest,
respectively. Digital records from the EATH development accompany this report.

9.0       CONCLUSIONS
WSP evaluated the site-specific seismic hazard at the Louvicourt TSF site through probabilistic analysis for AEPs
of 1/2,475, 1/5,000, and 1/10,000. We implemented the CanadaSHM6 seismic source models for southeastern
Canada along with the 17 NGA-East GMMs, AA13 standard deviation model, and equally weighted site
amplification models developed for the CENA region. Results are presented for the Louvicourt TSF site measured
seismic ground condition with a VS30 = 1,853 m/s.

The results of the probabilistic analysis indicate that:

▪   The site is within a region of generally low historical earthquake activity in southwestern Québec, to the west
    of the more historically seismically active St. Lawrence and Ottawa-Gatineau areas (Figure 1).

▪   The seismic hazard at the Louvicourt TSF site is relatively low compared to other parts of southeast Canada.
    For example, the 1/10,000 AEP mean horizontal spectral accelerations (5%-damped) are 0.193 g, 0.350 g,
    and 0.122 g for PGA, 0.2 s, and 1.0 s spectral periods, respectively (Figure 14).

▪   The dominant contributors to the seismic hazard across all spectral periods evaluated are moderate- to large-
    magnitude earthquakes (~Mw 6.8 to Mw 7.4) at distances of about 100 km to 200 km from the Louvicourt TSF
    site (Figure 15, Figure 16, Figure 17, and Table 6).

▪   There are some smaller contributions to the seismic hazard from moderate-magnitude earthquakes (typically
    Mw <6.0) within about 40 km of the site, particularly at short spectral periods (PGA and 0.2 s), and from
    moderate- to large-magnitude earthquakes (Mw 6.8 to Mw 7.4) at greater source-to-site distances (about 360
    km and greater).

▪   The seismic hazard estimate for the Louvicourt TSF site from this SSSHA is higher than indicated in the 2020
    NBCC (at 1/2,475 AEP) by up to 43%. The primary reason for the higher estimate is our application of more
    recent GMMs and site amplification models than those used for the 2020 NBCC.
