As described below, the decision to implement the CanadaSHM6 sources without modification was made
following investigation of the suitability of the existing earthquake occurrence rates associated with the sources.

4.1        Earthquake Locations and Activity Rates
Development of a SSSHA requires a comprehensive understanding of the spatial and temporal distribution of
observed earthquakes for the region surrounding a site. Figure 1 shows the distribution of the larger (moment
magnitude [Mw]≥2.5) pre-instrumental and instrumental earthquakes in the region surrounding the Louvicourt TSF
site. While the larger earthquakes provide the general pattern of significant and damaging earthquakes, a more
detailed analysis of the seismicity distribution in location, time, and magnitude is required for seismic hazard
assessment.

The Seismic Hazard Earthquake Epicentre File (SHEEF2010; Halchuk et al., 2015) was developed by GSC to
allow the estimation of earthquake occurrence rates for the fifth-generation seismic hazard model of Canada
(CanadaSHM5). The SHEEF2010 catalogue was subsequently used by GSC to parameterize the CanadaSHM6
seismic source models. The catalogue includes events with an original catalogue magnitude of 2.5 of higher.
SHEEF2010 contains earthquake records from 1627 up to the end of 2010. The catalogue is not declustered.
Figure 1 shows the location and magnitude of historical earthquakes in southeastern Canada and northeastern
USA. Figure 2 shows the epicenters located within about 100 km of the Louvicourt TSF site.

When developing recurrence parameters for seismic hazard analysis, it is important to understand the period for
which the earthquake catalogue is complete. The completeness period of the catalogue varies with earthquake
magnitude. Table 2 lists the year of catalogue completeness estimated for each magnitude bin (Mw 0.5 bin width)
using the Stepp (1972) procedure.

 3.0 ≤ Mw < 3.5                    1925

 3.5 ≤ Mw < 4.0                    1900

 Mw ≥ 4.0                          1860

Earthquakes of Mw 2.5 and greater from January 2011 to present for the region within about 1,000 km of the
Louvicourt TSF site were obtained from the National Earthquake Database online earthquake catalogue. This
catalogue is subsequently called the “post-SHEEF2010 catalogue” in this assessment. The post-SHEEF2010
earthquakes were reported in various measures of earthquake magnitude and were, therefore, converted to Mw
following the conversion relations provided in Halchuk et al. (2015). Figure 5 shows the magnitude-frequency
distribution for the SHEEF2010 and post-SHEEF2010 catalogues, and a catalogue that combines the two. The
close agreement between the SHEEF2010 and summed catalogues indicates that earthquakes from January
2011 to present day within about 1,000 km of the Louvicourt TSF site have an insignificant effect on the
earthquake recurrence parameters near the site. As a result, changes to the CanadaSHM6 seismic source
models are considered unnecessary. The CanadaSHM6 source models, therefore, are used for this assessment
as published by Kolaj et al. (2023).

4.2        Canadian National Seismic Source Model
The seismic source model used in this assessment is adopted from the CanadaSHM6 source models described
by Kolaj et al. (2023; Natural Resources Canada [NRCan] Open File 8924). CanadaSHM6 is the latest national
consensus seismic hazard model for Canada. CanadaSHM6 consists of three regional models based on their
location:

▪   Southeastern Canada

▪   Western Canada

▪   Eastern Arctic Canada

The Louvicourt TSF site is located within the southeastern (SE) part of the CanadaSHM6 model. For SE Canada,
the seismic source models and earthquake recurrence parameters included in CanadaSHM6 are unchanged from
those developed by Halchuk et al. (2015) for CanadaSHM5. Halchuk et al. (2014) provides details on the
development of the SE Canada seismic sources and their relative weights. Kolaj et al. (2020) provides specific
details for implementation of CanadaSHM6 in SE Canada.

The SE CanadaSHM6 source model comprises three separate sub-models: the Historical (H2), Regional (R2),
and Hybrid (HY) sub-models, as shown in Figure 6a, Figure 6b, and Figure 6c, respectively. Source parameters in
the H2 sub-model are based on historical earthquake locations and magnitudes. The R2 sub-model was
developed using the regional geological criteria as the basis for selection of the seismic source parameters, and
the HY sub-model was developed using both historical earthquake data and regional geological parameters.
Weights of 0.4, 0.2, and 0.4 are assigned in CanadaSHM6 to the H2, R2, and HY sub-models, respectively.

Each seismic source in the SE Canada model consists of a given area that is assigned a set of parameters to
represent the characteristics and rate of earthquake occurrence in that area. The three alternative sub-models in
SE Canada each have varying model parameters and relative weights for each parameter. The weighted
parameters are implemented using a logic tree approach to capture uncertainties in the seismic modelling
process. The logic tree approach is discussed further in Section 6.0.

5.0       GROUND MOTION MODELS
Ground motion models (GMM) are used in seismic hazard analysis to estimate the source-to-site attenuation of
earthquake ground motions at PGA and at other spectral periods as a function of the earthquake magnitude,
source-to-site distance, local site ground conditions, and other factors. The GMMs are typically empirically
derived, with the calculated acceleration values usually assuming 5% of critical damping, as in this assessment.
The sections below describe the how GMMs were evaluated and selected for this assessment.

5.1        GMMs used for CanadaSHM6
CanadaSHM6 considered the preliminary suite of 13 GMMs developed for NGA-East (Goulet et al., 2017a,b). The
goal of the NGA-East project was to create a ground motion characterization model for Central and Eastern North
America (CENA) comprising a set of mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive GMMs (that is, the individual
GMMs do not overlap and together represent the full range of ground motions). The resulting preliminary suite of
NGA-East GMMs comprised 13 different models defined for 25 ground-motion intensity measures with frequency-
dependent weighting factors. Each model is weighted to reflect the joint distribution of median ground motion
estimates at different magnitude-distance scenarios for a given frequency and their fit to observed ground-motion
data. The preliminary 13 NGA-East GMMs have now been superseded, as noted in the addendum to PEER
Report 2017-03 (Goulet et al. 2017a,b).

CanadaSHM6 uses two suites of GMMs with the following weights (Kolaj et al., 2019):

▪   The AA13 median and standard deviation ground motions from CanadaSHM5. Weighted 50%.

▪   The preliminary (superseded) 13 NGA-East median ground motions with the standard deviation model from
    CanadaSHM5 AA13 GMMs. Weighted 50%.

5.1.1        AA13 GMMs
The AA13 GMMs used in CanadaSHM5 (Atkinson and Adams, 2013) represent several different approaches to
model ground motion attenuation in eastern North America (ENA). There are five ENA models: Pezeshk et al.
(2011), Atkinson and Boore (2006), as revised in Atkinson and Boore (2011), Atkinson (2008), as revised in
Atkinson and Boore (2011), Silva et al. (2002) single-corner (variable stress) and double-corner (with saturation).

The AA13 GMMs use the moment magnitude and closest source-to-site rupture plane as inputs and are
applicable to magnitudes ranging from Mw 4.8 to Mw 8.0, and for source-to-site distances of up to 600 km.
Aleatory variability in the AA13 GMMs is represented by a standard deviation (sigma) model that attempts to
capture the natural variability of hypothetical future events.

The standard deviation model developed with the AA13 GMMs consists of sigma values that vary based on
spectral period and is lower than other standard deviation models (e.g., Boore and Atkinson, 2008, or NGA-East
standard deviation models) to avoid any double-counting of aleatory variability and epistemic uncertainty.

5.1.2        NGA-East GMMs
The preliminary 13 NGA-East GMMs (Goulet et al., 2017a) were developed for a reference hard-rock site
condition with an average shear-wave velocity in the upper 30 m (i.e., VS30) of 3,000 m/s. The GMMs use the
moment magnitude and the closest source-to-site rupture plane as inputs. The GMMs are applicable to
magnitudes ranging from Mw 4 to Mw 8.2, and for source-to-site distances of up to 1,500 km. Variations in the
expected ground motion are quantified and applied in the GMMs by use of a standard deviation (sigma) model, or



                                                                                                                   20
January 15, 2024                                                                             006-21494974.5000-Rev0




the total ergodic standard deviation model, which includes between-event variability and single-station within-
event variability. Each component of ground motion variability was analyzed and compared to ground motion
variability in other regions, particularly the western United States (WUS). The final models derived for each
component of ground motion variability are largely based on NGA-West2 relationships for shallow crustal
earthquakes in active tectonic regions (Abrahamson et al., 2014; Boore et al., 2014; Campbell and Bozorgnia,
2014; Chiou and Youngs, 2014), residuals analysis, and standard deviation models. The final GMMs are both
magnitude-and period-dependent.

Since the limited CENA dataset was used to develop the NGA-East GMMs, standard deviation models from other
regions, including the western USA and Japan, were used to inform the extrapolation of CENA standard
deviations to large magnitudes and frequencies outside of the 1 Hz to 10 Hz frequency range. The standard
deviation models published in NGA-East have high sigma values and lead to a large discrepancy between median
and mean ground motions. As such, the NGA-East standard deviation models were not implemented with the
median ground motions for CanadaSHM6 for this site-specific SHA.

5.2        GMMs used for this Site-Specific Assessment
For this assessment WSP has used the final suite of 17 GMMs developed for the Next Generation Attenuation for
Central and Eastern North America (CENA) project (NGA-East, Goulet et al. 2018) to calculate median ground
motions along with the standard deviation model from Atkinson and Adams (2013) (AA13). These 17 GMMs
supersede the preliminary set of 13 NGA-East GMMs (described above) that were implemented in CanadaSHM6.

The 17 NGA-East GMMs reflect the most up-to-date published and vetted GMMs developed for stable continental
regions (SCRs) in central and eastern North America. The NGA-East median ground motions are suitable to
model earthquake ground motion attenuation for this assessment because they were developed with a robust
process for a tectonic region (i.e., SCR) like that surrounding the Louvicourt TSF site. The final 17 NGA-East
GMMs are used in this assessment in conjunction with the AA13 standard deviation model as implemented in
CanadaSHM6.

5.3        Site Amplification Model
For southeastern Canada, CanadaSHM6 uses the site amplification factors applied in CanadaSHM5 with the
AA13 GMMs and a site model that combines two existing amplification models for the preliminary 13 NGA East
GMMs. The CanadaSHM6 site amplification models are described in detail by Kolaj et al. (2019).

Since the development of CanadaSHM6, the NGA-East GMMs have been used to update the US National
Seismic Hazard Maps for the CENA Region (Petersen et al., 2020). Recommendations for the ergodic site
amplification model in the CENA were provided by Stewart et al. (2020) and Hashash et al. (2020) to produce the
earthquake ground motion intensity measures for site conditions with a VS30 less than the 3,000 m/s reference
hard-rock condition, as adopted for the NGA-East GMM development.

For this assessment we have applied equally weighted Stewart et al. (2020) and Hashash et al. (2020) site
amplification models to adjust the site condition from the NGA-East reference hard-rock condition with a VS30 of
3,000 m/s to the site-specific VS30 condition of 1,853 m/s.

6.0       SOURCE MODEL AND GMM UNCERTAINTY
Epistemic uncertainty is the uncertainty associated with the simplified and imprecisely known scientific model of a
natural process. This uncertainty is typically parameterized by considering alternative model input parameters to
the PSHA (e.g., Abrahamson 2006, 2009). The input model parameters include the seismic source models, their
recurrence parameters and maximum earthquake magnitudes, hypocentral depth, and the ground motion models.
Epistemic uncertainty is commonly accommodated through a logic-tree approach.

For this assessment, WSP has adopted the input parameters, logic tree, and weighting values implemented for
CanadaSHM6. In CanadaSHM6, the two magnitude-frequency distribution (MFD) branches of the logic tree,
comprising three alternative recurrence parameter (a- and b-values) branches and three alternative Mmax
branches, were collapsed into a single MFD branch for computational efficiency. While collapsing these two
branches in the logic tree had a negligible impact on median hazard values produced using CanadaSHM6, it limits
the ability to perform a detailed analysis of the fractiles or model input sensitivity tests.

Figure 7 shows the logic tree implemented in this assessment. Parameters and weights for the CanadaSHM6
seismic source models are taken from Kolaj et al., (2023). Period- and model-dependent weights for the final suite
of 17 NGA-East GMMs are implemented as recommended by Goulet et al., (2018).
