## 4.1 Earthquake Locations and Activity Rates

Development of a SSSHA requires a comprehensive understanding of the spatial and temporal distribution of observed earthquakes for the region surrounding a site. Figure 1 shows the distribution of the larger (moment magnitude [Mw]≥2.5) pre-instrumental and instrumental earthquakes in the region surrounding the Louvicourt TSF site. While the larger earthquakes provide the general pattern of significant and damaging earthquakes, a more detailed analysis of the seismicity distribution in location, time, and magnitude is required for seismic hazard assessment.

The Seismic Hazard Earthquake Epicentre File (SHEEF2010; [@Halchuk2015]) was developed by GSC to allow the estimation of earthquake occurrence rates for the fifth-generation seismic hazard model of Canada (CanadaSHM5). The SHEEF2010 catalogue was subsequently used by GSC to parameterize the CanadaSHM6 seismic source models. The catalogue includes events with an original catalogue magnitude of 2.5 of higher. SHEEF2010 contains earthquake records from 1627 up to the end of 2010. The catalogue is not declustered. Figure 1 shows the location and magnitude of historical earthquakes in southeastern Canada and northeastern USA. Figure 2 shows the epicenters located within about 100 km of the Louvicourt TSF site.

When developing recurrence parameters for seismic hazard analysis, it is important to understand the period for which the earthquake catalogue is complete. The completeness period of the catalogue varies with earthquake magnitude. Table 2 lists the year of catalogue completeness estimated for each magnitude bin (Mw 0.5 bin width) using the [@Stepp1972] procedure.

**Table 2: Estimated Completeness Periods for the SHEEF2010 Catalogue** ([@Halchuk2015]).

| Magnitude Range (Mw) | Catalogue Completeness Year |
|----------------------|----------------------------|
| 3.0 ≤ Mw < 3.5 | 1925 |
| 3.5 ≤ Mw < 4.0 | 1900 |
| Mw ≥ 4.0 | 1860 |

Earthquakes of Mw 2.5 and greater from January 2011 to present for the region within about 1,000 km of the Louvicourt TSF site were obtained from the National Earthquake Database online earthquake catalogue. This catalogue is subsequently called the "post-SHEEF2010 catalogue" in this assessment. The post-SHEEF2010 earthquakes were reported in various measures of earthquake magnitude and were, therefore, converted to Mw following the conversion relations provided in [@Halchuk2015]. Figure 5 shows the magnitude-frequency distribution for the SHEEF2010 and post-SHEEF2010 catalogues, and a catalogue that combines the two. The close agreement between the SHEEF2010 and summed catalogues indicates that earthquakes from January 2011 to present day within about 1,000 km of the Louvicourt TSF site have an insignificant effect on the earthquake recurrence parameters near the site. As a result, changes to the CanadaSHM6 seismic source models are considered unnecessary. The CanadaSHM6 source models, therefore, are used for this assessment as published by [@Kolaj2023].

## 4.2 Canadian National Seismic Source Model

The seismic source model used in this assessment is adopted from the CanadaSHM6 source models described by [@Kolaj2023] (Natural Resources Canada [NRCan] Open File 8924). CanadaSHM6 is the latest national consensus seismic hazard model for Canada. CanadaSHM6 consists of three regional models based on their location:

- Southeastern Canada
- Western Canada
- Eastern Arctic Canada

The Louvicourt TSF site is located within the southeastern (SE) part of the CanadaSHM6 model. For SE Canada, the seismic source models and earthquake recurrence parameters included in CanadaSHM6 are unchanged from those developed by [@Halchuk2015] for CanadaSHM5. [@Halchuk2014] provides details on the development of the SE Canada seismic sources and their relative weights. [@Kolaj2020] provides specific details for implementation of CanadaSHM6 in SE Canada.

The SE CanadaSHM6 source model comprises three separate sub-models: the Historical (H2), Regional (R2), and Hybrid (HY) sub-models, as shown in Figure 6a, Figure 6b, and Figure 6c, respectively. Source parameters in the H2 sub-model are based on historical earthquake locations and magnitudes. The R2 sub-model was developed using the regional geological criteria as the basis for selection of the seismic source parameters, and the HY sub-model was developed using both historical earthquake data and regional geological parameters. Weights of 0.4, 0.2, and 0.4 are assigned in CanadaSHM6 to the H2, R2, and HY sub-models, respectively.

Each seismic source in the SE Canada model consists of a given area that is assigned a set of parameters to represent the characteristics and rate of earthquake occurrence in that area. The three alternative sub-models in SE Canada each have varying model parameters and relative weights for each parameter. The weighted parameters are implemented using a logic tree approach to capture uncertainties in the seismic modelling process. The logic tree approach is discussed further in Section 6.0.
