▪   Characteristics of source-to-site earthquake ground motion attenuation, and near-source effects if any, on
    estimated ground motions as incorporated in state-of-practice ground motion models (GMMs).

▪   Effects of subsurface site ground conditions considered either by using GMMs that represent an average site
    response from global or regional observations, or by undertaking a site-specific seismic ground response
    analysis (SGRA).

▪   Aleatory variability in maximum earthquake magnitudes, and epistemic uncertainty in the ground motion
    models and other seismic hazard model inputs.

Preliminary notions of PSHA were provided by Cornell (1968). The PSHA method uses available historical
seismic and geological data to characterize the seismic sources adjacent to the site of interest. Earthquake
recurrence parameters are used to estimate the earthquake activity rate for each seismic source. The earthquake
recurrence behavior for a seismic source is characterized by a frequency-magnitude relationship with the most
common being the truncated exponential recurrence model that typically follows a log-linear frequency magnitude
relationship as proposed by Gutenberg and Richter (1954) and expressed as:

                                                  Log N = a – b M

Where “N” is the cumulative number of earthquakes greater than or equal to M, the moment magnitude (Mw), per
year (earthquake annual rate), and “a” and “b” are constants. The “a-value” represents the earthquake activity rate
or number of events greater than zero magnitude. The “b-value” is the slope of the log-linear frequency magnitude
relationship and controls the relative occurrence rates of different magnitude earthquakes. Lower b-value
represent higher relative occurrence rate of larger earthquakes, and hence higher overall seismic hazard. In
general:

▪   Earthquake a- and b-values are estimated based on the analysis of historical earthquake records, plate
    motion velocities, and average fault slip rates. The minimum earthquake magnitude used to calculate activity
    parameters is based on the completeness of available earthquake catalogues.

▪   The maximum earthquake magnitudes (Mmax) are estimated based on observed earthquakes, historical
    estimates, and instrumentally recorded earthquakes, and/or empirical relationships between fault parameters,
    such as fault area and maximum or average single-event slip, and earthquake magnitude.

▪   The minimum magnitude for hazard calculation (Mmin) is based on the expected minimum earthquake
    magnitude that may have some impact on the structures or facilities to be analyzed. The M min for hazard
    calculation is not the same (and is generally larger) than the minimum magnitude used to calculate
    earthquake activity rates from the historical and instrumental earthquake catalogues. An Mmin of Mw 4.8 is
    used for hazard calculations in this assessment.

GMMs are empirical earthquake ground motion attenuation relationships and/or theoretical models used to
estimate the site ground motion given the magnitude, source-to-site distance, and site soil conditions. Typically,
more than one GMM is selected and weighted in the PSHA analysis.

The seismic source models and GMMs are used in PSHA to estimate the likelihood (AEP) and intensity of
earthquake ground motions for a site with given site ground conditions. PSHA outputs include:

▪   Mean hazard curves that describe earthquake ground motion intensity at a particular spectral period across a
    range of likelihoods. Fractiles hazard curves describe the uncertainty in the mean hazard curve estimate



                                                                                                                     5
January 15, 2024                                                                                  006-21494974.5000-Rev0




    based on the uncertainties included in the seismic source model and the uncertainties within and between
    selected ground motion models.

▪   The UHS is the uniform-hazard, 5%-damped, mean, RotD50, peak-horizontal, spectral acceleration across a
    range of spectral-periods. The components of this definition are described below for clarity:

     ▪ Uniform-hazard. Each point on the mean UHS has an equal likelihood of occurrence (e.g., AEP).
     ▪ 5%-damped. The UHS describes the estimated elastic-response of inverted pendula to an earthquake
          ground motion, damping can be applied to the response to describe the loss of energy in transmission.
          5%-damping is the typically reported value and is incorporated in the GMMs implemented in this study.
          For some engineering applications alternative damping values are used.

     ▪ Mean. The UHS plots mean spectral acceleration values at each spectral period resulting from the
          weighted range of hazard curves incorporated in the PSHA computation. The fractiles of the UHS
          describe the range of spectral accelerations at each spectral period, based on the uncertainties and
          variability incorporated in the PSHA.

     ▪ RotD50 is a statistically derived median value of the possible horizontal components of recorded
          earthquake ground motions (e.g., Boore et. al., 2006). Earthquake ground motions are recorded in three
          orientations, two horizontal and one vertical. The two horizontal components are typically different (one is
          larger than the other) depending on several factors including the orientation of the strong motion
          recording instruments. The RotD50 is a slightly different intensity measure from the geometric mean.
          RotD50 is adopted as the predicted earthquake intensity measure in the GMMs used in this study.

     ▪ Peak-horizontal spectral acceleration. The UHS describes the peak-horizontal acceleration (as a
          fraction of the acceleration due to gravity, g, i.e., approximately 9.8 m/s) at each spectral period. This
          peak is only likely to be experienced once during an earthquake and for a short duration.

▪   PSHA results can also be used to identify earthquake magnitude and source-to-site distance pairs and/or
    specific seismic sources that are the major contributor(s) to the seismic hazard at the site of interest. Thus
    “disaggregation analysis” can be undertaken for any AEP and spectral period combination. The
    disaggregations presented in this assessment are enhanced by plotting the distribution of epsilon for each
    combination of distance and magnitude. Epsilon is the number of standard deviations in the GMMs and
    informs selection of earthquake scenarios from the PSHA.

Mean hazard curves and fractiles for selected AEPs, disaggregation of hazard at important spectral periods and
AEPs, UHS for other than mean hazard, and sensitivity analyses are common PSHA outputs. Importantly, the
frequency and inherent uncertainties of the occurrence rate of different magnitude earthquakes on a seismic
source are directly accounted for in PSHA, as well as the spatial distribution of each earthquake magnitude within
a seismic source. A comprehensive PSHA incorporates not only the inherent randomness of earthquake
occurrence and seismic wave propagation (i.e., aleatory variability), but also the uncertainties associated with the
choice of models and model parameters to characterize seismic sources and estimate earthquake ground
motions (i.e., epistemic uncertainty). Epistemic uncertainty is commonly accommodated through a logic-tree
approach in PSHA. Accordingly, no additional conservatism is normally added to the mean UHS from a
comprehensive PSHA. The degree of conservatism is explicitly defined by the choice of the AEP.

2.0       SITE GROUND CONDITIONS
A key input into any site-specific PSHA is the near-surface ground conditions at the analysis site. Near-surface
ground conditions are incorporated into site-specific PSHA using the following parameters specified in most
modern GMMs (Section 5.0):

▪   VS30: The time-averaged shear-wave velocity for the upper 30 m below ground surface. When used along
    with seismic ground response analysis (SGRA) the VS30 is the time averaged shear-wave velocity for 30 m
    depth below the top of the seismic engineering bedrock.

▪   Z1.0: The depth to a shear-wave velocity of 1,000 m/s.

▪   Z2.5: The depth to a shear-wave velocity of 2,500 m/s.

While VS30 is used in most modern GMMs, the Z1.0 and Z2.5 parameters are only used in selected GMMs, such as
those developed as part of the NGA-West2 project for active crustal sources.

2.1        Selection of VS30
This SSSHA was undertaken for a VS30 of 1,853 m/s. This seismic ground condition was evaluated by Golder
(2021) from geophysical investigations using the multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) method
adjacent to the intersection between Dams 1C, 1D, and 4B of the TSF at Louvicourt Mine. This VS30 value was
provided to WSP for use in the SSSHA.

3.0       SEISMOTECTONIC SETTING
This section presents a brief overview of the seismotectonic setting of the Louvicourt TSF site in southwestern
Québec. The purpose is to describe the geological history and current earthquake distribution with a focus on the
identification of any potential seismogenic structures capable of producing large earthquakes and strong ground
shaking at the Louvicourt TSF site. This section includes a summary of the site geology based principally on
publicly available information and summary information provided by Teck Resources Limited, including the
existing geotechnical studies as described in Golder (2012).

3.1        Regional Geological Setting
The Louvicourt TSF site is in western Québec within the Canadian Shield physiographic province of Canada
(Figure 1). The geomorphology of the region surrounding the site is controlled by distribution of Archean and
Proterozoic basement rocks (more than 2.7 billion years [Ga] old in places), and Pleistocene (less than about the
last 2.6 million years) glacial landforms such as fluvio-glacial outwash plains, eskers, and kames. The region has
a gentle, undulating topography and includes numerous small lakes and local streams. The topography was
developed by erosional processes occurring beneath the large continental glaciers of North America, and by
subsequent localized deposition and erosion following the most recent retreat of glacial ice about 15,000 to
12,000 years ago.

The site is in a region of the Canadian Shield that is part of the North American Craton. Cratons are regions
containing generally very old rocks (i.e., more than 1 Ga). Cratons are usually tectonically stable parts of the
continental lithosphere that have persisted through several cycles of continental rifting and basin formation,
followed by contraction with folding, faulting, and uplift of the sedimentary basins. Cratons typically consist of
crystalline basement and highly metamorphosed rocks flanked by relatively younger, metamorphosed
sedimentary rock units. The tectonic history of the Canadian Shield indicates that it is one of the oldest known
cratons and contains rocks dating back several billion years (e.g., Whitmeyer and Karlstrom, 2007).

The Canadian Shield is inferred to have formed from the collision of Archean-age microcontinents during the
Paleoproterozoic (2.5 to 1.6 Ga). The collision of these microcontinents initiated volcanic activity to form volcanic
arcs that accreted to and intruded into the existing Archean tectonic plates (i.e., Greenstone belts). The
microcontinents then combined to form the ancient continent of Laurentia. During the formation of Laurentia,
major tectonic events resulted in zones of faulted, folded and metamorphosed sedimentary and igneous rocks.
Whitmeyer and Karlstrom (2007) provide a comprehensive summary of the development and tectonic history of
the Canadian Shield and North America.

Figure 2 shows the locations of the major geological provinces and sub-provinces in southwestern Québec. The
boundary between the Abitibi and Pontiac sub-provinces of the Superior Province is marked by the major
structural complex of the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone. Figure 2 shows that the few earthquake epicenters
recorded in this region are widely distributed and generally not associated with these major mapped faults. While
three epicenters near the site are located within the wider Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone, earthquakes are
absent in other parts of the fault zone. The nature of the fault zone rocks, their present-day tectonic setting within
the Canadian Shield, a lack of earthquake epicenter alignments, and no geomorphic evidence for past surface
fault rupture all suggest that Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone and other major fault zones within the wider region
are at present seismically and geologically inactive. Accordingly, these faults are not included as discrete seismic
sources in the site-specific seismic source model developed for this study.




                                                                                                                     10

3.1.1        Historical Seismicity
Analysis of earthquake epicenters from the historical record (both anecdotal and instrumental) indicates that the
site is within a region of relatively low historical earthquake occurrence (Figure 1). For example, only five
earthquakes with moment magnitudes (Mw) more than 4.5 have been recorded within about 300 km of the
Louvicourt TSF site. All but one of these earthquakes has a reported magnitude less than Mw 5, with the 1935
Timiskaming earthquake (Mw 6.1) being the largest historical event known from the wider region surrounding the
site (Figure 1; approx. 190 km southwest of Louvicourt Mine).

3.2        Louvicourt Mine Site Geology
The local geological setting of the bedrock and the overburden of the site is presented in this section.

3.2.1        Bedrock Geology
Figure 3 shows the generalized bedrock geology at the Louvicourt Mine and TSF site and surrounding area. The
Louvicourt TSF site is within a region of Archaean volcanic and intrusive rocks of the Archean Southern Abitibi
greenstone belt that is part of the Superior Province of the Canadian Shield physiographic province (Figure 2).
The site is near the southern margin of the eastern portion of the Abitibi Sub-province that comprises an older
(Neoarchean) northern volcanic zone (2.730 to 2.710 Ga) and a relatively younger (Neoarchean) southern
volcanic zone (2.705 to 2.698 Ga), separated by the regional Porcupine-Destor Fault Zone (e.g., Card and
Poulsen, 1998). The Abitibi Subprovince is limited to the north by gneissic metamorphic and igneous plutons of
the Opatica Sub-province, and to the south by metasediments and intrusive rocks of the Pontiac Sub-province.

The contact between the Pontiac Sub-province and the rocks of the Abitibi greenstone belt is the east-west
striking Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone (Figure 2). The Louvicourt Mine and TSF site is located within the wider
Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone about 10 km north of the main sub-Province contact (Figure 2). Where exposed
and mapped in the foundation excavations for Dam 1 in 1993, the bedrock is relatively closely jointed, intruded by
diabase (dolerite) dykes up to several meters wide, and cut by numerous faults and shear zones that have
predominately northwest-southeast and north-northwest-south-southeast strikes (Golder, 2012). Faults mapped in
the foundation exposures have moderate to steep dips. These faults presumably represent localised deformation
associated with the development of the nearby Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone.

3.2.2        Surficial Geology
Figure 4 shows the generalized surficial geology at the Louvicourt Mine and TSF site and surrounding area, as
described by Veillette et al. (2010). Surficial deposits cover most of the TSF site. At Dam 1, surficial deposits were
stripped off when less than 2 m thick, and bedrock was exposed in parts of the key trench (as described in
Section 3.2.1). Surficial deposits underlie the Dam 2 foundations and were derived from the deposition and
erosion that occurred beneath the large continental Pleistocene glaciers of North America. These glaciers most
recently melted and retreated northward about 15,000 to 12,000 years ago. Surficial sediments at the site are
associated with various glacial and fluvioglacial environments, including till, lacustrine deep, shallow and littoral
deposits, and post-glacial accumulations of silt and organic deposits (Figure 4). The superficial deposits are
laterally variable in thickness, ranging from a thin veneer to more than 20 m thick (Golder, 2012).
