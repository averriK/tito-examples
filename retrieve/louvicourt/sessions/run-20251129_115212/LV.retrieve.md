# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents the results of a site-specific seismic hazard assessment (SSSHA) undertaken by WSP Canada (WSP) for the tailings storage facility (TSF) at Teck's closed Louvicourt Mine site in southwestern Québec. The assessment is for Dam 1D of the Louvicourt TSF (48.135°N latitude and 77.595°W longitude). Dam 1D was selected for the SSSHA because it is likely the critical structure for the overall stability of the TSF. The SSSHA includes probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) used to estimate earthquake ground motions with annual exceedance probabilities (AEPs) of 1/2,475, 1/5,000, and 1/10,000. The SSSHA also provides earthquake acceleration time histories (EATHs) amplitude-scaled to the 1/10,000 AEP site-specific mean uniform hazard spectrum (UHS) from the PSHA.

The Louvicourt SSSHA is based on seismic source models developed for southeastern Canada by the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) for the 6th Generation Seismic Hazard Model of Canada (CanadaSHM6). The tectonic setting, seismicity rates, and earthquake distribution within about 600 km of the Louvicourt TSF site were reviewed to confirm the suitability of the CanadaSHM6 seismic source models for the SSSHA. Earthquake ground motions were evaluated by applying the 17 NGA-East ground motion models (GMMs) and 2020 site amplification models developed for central and eastern North America (CENA). These GMMs and site amplification models supersede those used by GSC with the CanadaSHM6 source models. Site amplification was based on the measured time-averaged shear-wave velocity over 30 m below the bedrock (VS30) of 1,853 m/s.

Table S1 lists the mean and selected fractile uniform hazard spectral ordinates developed from the site-specific PSHA at AEPs of 1/2,475, 1/5,000, and 1/10,000:

The site-specific PSHA results are higher than those reported in the 2020 National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) for the same site, ground conditions and the VS30 of 1,853 m/s. These differences are primarily because of our use of the 17 NGA East GMMs and recent site amplification models.

The site-specific PSHA results, including UHS and magnitude-distance-epsilon disaggregation, inform the development of representative EATHs for use in future geotechnical analyses. WSP developed EATHs at two fundamental periods important to the Louvicourt TSF site – a shorter fundamental period, TS = 0.25 to 0.37 s, and a longer fundamental period, TL = 1.15 s. Eight, two-horizontal-component EATHs from the NGA-West2 ground motion database were amplitude-scaled to match the 1/10,000 mean UHS within a period range of interest specific to each of the fundamental periods. Secondary intensity measures (IMs) were considered to establish the suitability of the selected EATHs.

See Section 1.3 for further details.

# 1.0 INTRODUCTION

This report describes the data, methods, technical developments, and results of site-specific seismic hazard assessment (SSSHA) undertaken for Teck Resources Ltd's closed tailings storage facility (TSF) at Louvicourt Mine near Val d'Or, Québec, Canada (Figure 1). For the purposes of this assessment, seismic analysis was completed by WSP Canada Limited. (WSP) for a site at 48.135°N latitude and 77.595°W longitude ('the Louvicourt TSF site'). This location corresponds to Dam 1D of the TSF. Dam 1D was selected for the SSSHA because this is understood to be the critical structure for the overall stability of the TSF.

The SSSHA was undertaken for Teck Resources Ltd (Teck) as part of the work scope described in Teck's change order CO-03 dated September 15, 2023, and associated purchase order PO-353 dated April 29, 2022.

## 1.1 Scope of Work

The purpose of this SSSHA is to quantify earthquake ground motions with an annual exceedance probability (AEP) of 1/2,475, 1/5,000, and 1/10,000. These AEPs are approximately equivalent to return periods of 2,475-, 5,000-, and 1/10,000-years, respectively.

WSP undertook the following major tasks for the SSSHA:

- Acquisition and review of available information on historical earthquakes, regional tectonics, and potential faults within about 600 km of the Louvicourt TSF site.

- Review of seismic source models developed by the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) and Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) for the 2020 National Building Code of Canada (2020 NBCC).

- Development of logic trees to capture epistemic uncertainty in the site-specific seismic source model inputs and ground motion models (GMMs).

- Completion of site-specific probabilistic seismic hazard analyses (PSHA) to produce mean and fractile hazard curves for selected spectral periods (peak ground acceleration [PGA], 0.2 seconds [s], 0.5 s, 1.0 s, and 2.0 s), and uniform hazard spectra (UHS) for selected AEPs (1/2,475, 1/5,000, and 1/10,000).

- Magnitude-distance-epsilon deaggregation of site-specific seismic hazard to identify the earthquake magnitudes and distances that make the greater contribution to the site hazard for the 1/10,000 AEP at PGA, 0.2 s, 0.5 s, and 1.0 s.

- Development of eight, two-horizontal-component earthquake acceleration-time histories (EATHs), matched to the 1/10,000 AEP uniform hazard spectral accelerations to support dynamic stability, settlement, and liquefaction analyses at the site, as needed by the project engineers.

- Preparation of this report for Teck's review and comment.

## 1.2 Terminology

Table 1 lists key terms and alternative, similar terms that relate technical terms used in this report to other commonly used terms. A glossary of abbreviations found in this report can be found in Appendix A.

### Table 1: Terminology Used in this Report.

| Technical Term and Units | Alternative Similar Terms (units and definition may vary) |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Spectral period (seconds, s) | Period, natural-period, period-of-vibration, natural frequency |
| Acceleration (percentage of gravitational acceleration, g) | Peak horizontal acceleration, spectral acceleration |
| Annual exceedance probability (AEP) | Return period (years), frequency, annual probability of exceedance (APE) |
| Uniform hazard spectrum (UHS) | Uniform hazard curve, acceleration response spectrum, response spectrum, spectral response spectrum, uniform hazard acceleration response spectrum, uniform hazard mean acceleration response spectrum |
| Ground Motion Model (GMM) | Ground motion prediction equation (GMPE), attenuation equation |

A comprehensive seismic hazard assessment should in general account for the:
## 4 Results

### 4.1 Baseline PSHA

Figure 4 shows the Uniform Hazard Spectra (UHS) for the Louvicourt Project for 2 % and 10 % in 50 years probabilities of exceedance. These probabilities are equivalent to 2,475 and 475-year return periods, respectively. The tables in Appendix B give the median and 84th percentile spectral accelerations in g for periods of 0.01 to 5.0 seconds.

### 4.2 Site-Specific Ground-Motion Model

Figure 5 compares the 475-year return period UHS for the site-specific ground-motion model to that from the baseline analysis. As anticipated based on the results presented in Kolaj et al., the site-specific model results are typically lower than those from the baseline model, particularly at short periods (T < 1.0 s), for the 475-year return period. For the 2,475-year return period, the results are more similar (Figure 6). Figure 7 shows the median UHS for 2 %, 5 %, and 10 % in 50 years probabilities of exceedance. The GMM logic tree given in Table 2 results in median peak ground accelerations (PGA; T = 0.01 s) of approximately 0.057g, 0.079g, and 0.113g for 475-, 975-, and 2,475-year return periods, respectively. These values are 15 %, 12 %, and 6 % of those given by the 2020 NBCC seismic hazard model for a hard rock site (0.397g, 0.673g, and 1.206g for 475-, 975-, and 2,475-year return periods, respectively). For Quebec, values are given for both classes A and B, this project is analogous to class A which must be multiplied by a coefficient of 2/3 for the code values. The code values for class A are then 0.265g, 0.449g, and 0.804g for 475-, 975-, and 2,475-year return periods, respectively. Accordingly, the site-specific values are 21 %, 18 %, and 14 % of the 2020 NBCC values for class A.

For the 2,475-year return period, rock sites in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) can be considered analogous to those for this project. The 2020 NBCC probabilistic seismic hazard for a hypothetical site at 53.0°N, 113.0°W (roughly Fort Saskatchewan) gives a PGA of 0.049g. The site-specific values are more than double the NBCC values for the analogous WCSB site.

Tables B1 and B2 in Appendix B present the median and 84th percentile spectral accelerations in g from the site-specific analysis. Figures 8 and 9 compare the site-specific ground-motion results to those from the 2020 NBCC for site classes A and C.

### 4.3 Deaggregation

Probabilistic seismic hazard deaggregation provides insight into which combinations of magnitude, distance, and epsilon contribute most to the seismic hazard. The epsilon (ε) value quantifies the number of standard deviations of difference in natural log units between the spectral acceleration predicted by the ground-motion model and the value corresponding to the hazard level of interest. A positive value means that ground motions larger than the median predicted by the ground-motion model are required to obtain the target hazard level. A negative value of epsilon means that even ground motions lower than the median ground-motion prediction result in the target hazard level.

Deaggregation for 475- and 2,475-year return periods at the spectral periods of 0.2 s, 1.0 s, and 2.0 s are presented in Figures 10 to 15. The "bin" mode earthquake magnitude and distance and mean epsilon values are reported in Table 4. The deaggregation show that the hazard contributions at spectral periods less than 1.0 s are approximately uniform for larger earthquakes to approximately 300 km distance. At longer spectral periods, slightly larger distances contribute more to the overall hazard.

### 4.4 Comparison to Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Values

For comparative purposes, Figure 16 compares the median results from this analysis to (i) the 2020 NBCC seismic hazard values for site class A (hard rock) and C (dense soil or soft rock); (ii) from GSC Open File 8796, Kolaj et al., and (iii) from an earlier PSHA conducted for the Louvicourt Project.

The site-specific ground-motion model for this project gives values that are typically lower than those from the baseline model, particularly at short periods (T < 1.0 s), for the 475-year return period. For the 2,475-year return period, the results are more similar. The site-specific ground-motion model values are generally much lower than the 2020 NBCC values and are more similar to or slightly higher than the values given by Kolaj et al. The spectral accelerations are similar to, but typically lower than, those from the earlier PSHA for this project (Tectonic, 2024).
# 3. Seismotectonic Setting

Seismic hazards in Quebec are primarily associated with the Western Quebec Seismic Zone (WQSZ) and Eastern Canada. The WQSZ is a region of elevated seismicity that includes the Ottawa Valley and extends into western Quebec. This zone has been the site of several historically significant earthquakes, including events in 1935 (M 6.1), 1944 (M 5.8), and more recently in 2010 (M 5.0).

The geological setting of the region is characterized by Precambrian Shield rocks overlain by Paleozoic sedimentary sequences. The seismicity in this region is generally attributed to the reactivation of ancient faults and weakness zones within the stable continental crust. Unlike active plate boundary regions, eastern Canada is classified as a Stable Continental Region (SCR), where earthquake occurrence is less frequent but can still produce damaging events.

The mechanisms driving intraplate seismicity in eastern Canada are not fully understood, but several factors are thought to contribute, including glacial isostatic adjustment following the retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, far-field stresses from plate boundary forces, and localized stress concentrations along pre-existing zones of weakness.

The depth distribution of earthquakes in the WQSZ typically ranges from shallow crustal events (less than 10 km) to mid-crustal depths (10-25 km). Focal mechanisms indicate predominantly reverse and strike-slip faulting, consistent with a compressional to transpressional stress regime.

Understanding the seismotectonic setting is crucial for assessing seismic hazards at the Louvicourt site, as it provides context for the regional seismicity patterns, maximum credible earthquake magnitudes, and expected ground motion characteristics.
As described below, the decision to implement the CanadaSHM6 sources without modification was made following investigation of the suitability of the existing earthquake occurrence rates associated with the sources.

## 4.1 Earthquake Locations and Activity Rates

Development of a SSSHA requires a comprehensive understanding of the spatial and temporal distribution of observed earthquakes for the region surrounding a site. Figure 1 shows the distribution of the larger (moment magnitude [Mw]≥2.5) pre-instrumental and instrumental earthquakes in the region surrounding the Louvicourt TSF site. While the larger earthquakes provide the general pattern of significant and damaging earthquakes, a more detailed analysis of the seismicity distribution in location, time, and magnitude is required for seismic hazard assessment.

The Seismic Hazard Earthquake Epicentre File (SHEEF2010; [@Halchuk2015]) was developed by GSC to allow the estimation of earthquake occurrence rates for the fifth-generation seismic hazard model of Canada (CanadaSHM5). The SHEEF2010 catalogue was subsequently used by GSC to parameterize the CanadaSHM6 seismic source models. The catalogue includes events with an original catalogue magnitude of 2.5 of higher. SHEEF2010 contains earthquake records from 1627 up to the end of 2010. The catalogue is not declustered. Figure 1 shows the location and magnitude of historical earthquakes in southeastern Canada and northeastern USA. Figure 2 shows the epicenters located within about 100 km of the Louvicourt TSF site.

When developing recurrence parameters for seismic hazard analysis, it is important to understand the period for which the earthquake catalogue is complete. The completeness period of the catalogue varies with earthquake magnitude. Table 2 lists the year of catalogue completeness estimated for each magnitude bin (Mw 0.5 bin width) using the [@Stepp1972] procedure.

Table 2: Estimated Completeness Periods for the SHEEF2010 Catalogue [@Halchuk2015].

| Magnitude Range (Mw) | Catalogue Completeness Year |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| 3.0 ≤ Mw < 3.5       | 1925                        |
| 3.5 ≤ Mw < 4.0       | 1900                        |
| Mw ≥ 4.0             | 1860                        |

Earthquakes of Mw 2.5 and greater from January 2011 to present for the region within about 1,000 km of the Louvicourt TSF site were obtained from the National Earthquake Database online earthquake catalogue. This catalogue is subsequently called the "post-SHEEF2010 catalogue" in this assessment. The post-SHEEF2010 earthquakes were reported in various measures of earthquake magnitude and were, therefore, converted to Mw following the conversion relations provided in [@Halchuk2015]. Figure 5 shows the magnitude-frequency distribution for the SHEEF2010 and post-SHEEF2010 catalogues, and a catalogue that combines the two. The close agreement between the SHEEF2010 and summed catalogues indicates that earthquakes from January 2011 to present day within about 1,000 km of the Louvicourt TSF site have an insignificant effect on the earthquake recurrence parameters near the site. As a result, changes to the CanadaSHM6 seismic source models are considered unnecessary. The CanadaSHM6 source models, therefore, are used for this assessment as published by [@Kolaj2023].

## 4.2 Canadian National Seismic Source Model

The seismic source model used in this assessment is adopted from the CanadaSHM6 source models described by [@Kolaj2023] (Natural Resources Canada [NRCan] Open File 8924). CanadaSHM6 is the latest national consensus seismic hazard model for Canada. CanadaSHM6 consists of three regional models based on their location:

- Southeastern Canada
- Western Canada
- Eastern Arctic Canada

The Louvicourt TSF site is located within the southeastern (SE) part of the CanadaSHM6 model. For SE Canada, the seismic source models and earthquake recurrence parameters included in CanadaSHM6 are unchanged from those developed by [@Halchuk2015] for CanadaSHM5. [@Halchuk2014] provides details on the development of the SE Canada seismic sources and their relative weights. [@Kolaj2020] provides specific details for implementation of CanadaSHM6 in SE Canada.

The SE CanadaSHM6 source model comprises three separate sub-models: the Historical (H2), Regional (R2), and Hybrid (HY) sub-models, as shown in Figure 6a, Figure 6b, and Figure 6c, respectively. Source parameters in the H2 sub-model are based on historical earthquake locations and magnitudes. The R2 sub-model was developed using the regional geological criteria as the basis for selection of the seismic source parameters, and the HY sub-model was developed using both historical earthquake data and regional geological parameters. Weights of 0.4, 0.2, and 0.4 are assigned in CanadaSHM6 to the H2, R2, and HY sub-models, respectively.

Each seismic source in the SE Canada model consists of a given area that is assigned a set of parameters to represent the characteristics and rate of earthquake occurrence in that area. The three alternative sub-models in SE Canada each have varying model parameters and relative weights for each parameter. The weighted parameters are implemented using a logic tree approach to capture uncertainties in the seismic modelling process. The logic tree approach is discussed further in Section 6.0.

## 5.0 GROUND MOTION MODELS

Ground motion models (GMM) are used in seismic hazard analysis to estimate the source-to-site attenuation of earthquake ground motions at PGA and at other spectral periods as a function of the earthquake magnitude, source-to-site distance, local site ground conditions, and other factors. The GMMs are typically empirically derived, with the calculated acceleration values usually assuming 5% of critical damping, as in this assessment. The sections below describe the how GMMs were evaluated and selected for this assessment.

## 5.1 GMMs used for CanadaSHM6

CanadaSHM6 considered the preliminary suite of 13 GMMs developed for NGA-East [@Goulet2017a][@Goulet2017b]. The goal of the NGA-East project was to create a ground motion characterization model for Central and Eastern North America (CENA) comprising a set of mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive GMMs (that is, the individual GMMs do not overlap and together represent the full range of ground motions). The resulting preliminary suite of NGA-East GMMs comprised 13 different models defined for 25 ground-motion intensity measures with frequency-dependent weighting factors. Each model is weighted to reflect the joint distribution of median ground motion estimates at different magnitude-distance scenarios for a given frequency and their fit to observed ground-motion data. The preliminary 13 NGA-East GMMs have now been superseded, as noted in the addendum to PEER Report 2017-03 [@Goulet2017a][@Goulet2017b].

CanadaSHM6 uses two suites of GMMs with the following weights [@Kolaj2019]:

- The AA13 median and standard deviation ground motions from CanadaSHM5. Weighted 50%.
- The preliminary (superseded) 13 NGA-East median ground motions with the standard deviation model from CanadaSHM5 AA13 GMMs. Weighted 50%.

### 5.1.1 AA13 GMMs

The AA13 GMMs used in CanadaSHM5 [@AtkinsonAdams2013] represent several different approaches to model ground motion attenuation in eastern North America (ENA). There are five ENA models: [@Pezeshk2011], [@AtkinsonBoore2006], as revised in [@AtkinsonBoore2011], [@Atkinson2008], as revised in [@AtkinsonBoore2011], [@Silva2002] single-corner (variable stress) and double-corner (with saturation).

The AA13 GMMs use the moment magnitude and closest source-to-site rupture plane as inputs and are applicable to magnitudes ranging from Mw 4.8 to Mw 8.0, and for source-to-site distances of up to 600 km. Aleatory variability in the AA13 GMMs is represented by a standard deviation (sigma) model that attempts to capture the natural variability of hypothetical future events.

The standard deviation model developed with the AA13 GMMs consists of sigma values that vary based on spectral period and is lower than other standard deviation models (e.g., [@BooreAtkinson2008], or NGA-East standard deviation models) to avoid any double-counting of aleatory variability and epistemic uncertainty.

### 5.1.2 NGA-East GMMs

The preliminary 13 NGA-East GMMs [@Goulet2017a] were developed for a reference hard-rock site condition with an average shear-wave velocity in the upper 30 m (i.e., VS30) of 3,000 m/s. The GMMs use the moment magnitude and the closest source-to-site rupture plane as inputs. The GMMs are applicable to magnitudes ranging from Mw 4 to Mw 8.2, and for source-to-site distances of up to 1,500 km. Variations in the expected ground motion are quantified and applied in the GMMs by use of a standard deviation (sigma) model, or the total ergodic standard deviation model, which includes between-event variability and single-station within-event variability. Each component of ground motion variability was analyzed and compared to ground motion variability in other regions, particularly the western United States (WUS). The final models derived for each component of ground motion variability are largely based on NGA-West2 relationships for shallow crustal earthquakes in active tectonic regions [@Abrahamson2014][@Boore2014][@CampbellBozorgnia2014][@ChiouYoungs2014], residuals analysis, and standard deviation models. The final GMMs are both magnitude-and period-dependent.

Since the limited CENA dataset was used to develop the NGA-East GMMs, standard deviation models from other regions, including the western USA and Japan, were used to inform the extrapolation of CENA standard deviations to large magnitudes and frequencies outside of the 1 Hz to 10 Hz frequency range. The standard deviation models published in NGA-East have high sigma values and lead to a large discrepancy between median and mean ground motions. As such, the NGA-East standard deviation models were not implemented with the median ground motions for CanadaSHM6 for this site-specific SHA.

## 5.2 GMMs used for this Site-Specific Assessment

For this assessment WSP has used the final suite of 17 GMMs developed for the Next Generation Attenuation for Central and Eastern North America (CENA) project (NGA-East, [@Goulet2018]) to calculate median ground motions along with the standard deviation model from [@AtkinsonAdams2013] (AA13). These 17 GMMs supersede the preliminary set of 13 NGA-East GMMs (described above) that were implemented in CanadaSHM6.

The 17 NGA-East GMMs reflect the most up-to-date published and vetted GMMs developed for stable continental regions (SCRs) in central and eastern North America. The NGA-East median ground motions are suitable to model earthquake ground motion attenuation for this assessment because they were developed with a robust process for a tectonic region (i.e., SCR) like that surrounding the Louvicourt TSF site. The final 17 NGA-East GMMs are used in this assessment in conjunction with the AA13 standard deviation model as implemented in CanadaSHM6.

## 5.3 Site Amplification Model

For southeastern Canada, CanadaSHM6 uses the site amplification factors applied in CanadaSHM5 with the AA13 GMMs and a site model that combines two existing amplification models for the preliminary 13 NGA East GMMs. The CanadaSHM6 site amplification models are described in detail by [@Kolaj2019].

Since the development of CanadaSHM6, the NGA-East GMMs have been used to update the US National Seismic Hazard Maps for the CENA Region [@Petersen2020]. Recommendations for the ergodic site amplification model in the CENA were provided by [@Stewart2020] and [@Hashash2020] to produce the earthquake ground motion intensity measures for site conditions with a VS30 less than the 3,000 m/s reference hard-rock condition, as adopted for the NGA-East GMM development.

For this assessment we have applied equally weighted [@Stewart2020] and [@Hashash2020] site amplification models to adjust the site condition from the NGA-East reference hard-rock condition with a VS30 of 3,000 m/s to the site-specific VS30 condition of 1,853 m/s.

## 6.0 SOURCE MODEL AND GMM UNCERTAINTY

Epistemic uncertainty is the uncertainty associated with the simplified and imprecisely known scientific model of a natural process. This uncertainty is typically parameterized by considering alternative model input parameters to the PSHA (e.g., [@Abrahamson2006][@Abrahamson2009]). The input model parameters include the seismic source models, their recurrence parameters and maximum earthquake magnitudes, hypocentral depth, and the ground motion models. Epistemic uncertainty is commonly accommodated through a logic-tree approach.

For this assessment, WSP has adopted the input parameters, logic tree, and weighting values implemented for CanadaSHM6. In CanadaSHM6, the two magnitude-frequency distribution (MFD) branches of the logic tree, comprising three alternative recurrence parameter (a- and b-values) branches and three alternative Mmax branches, were collapsed into a single MFD branch for computational efficiency. While collapsing these two branches in the logic tree had a negligible impact on median hazard values produced using CanadaSHM6, it limits the ability to perform a detailed analysis of the fractiles or model input sensitivity tests.

Figure 7 shows the logic tree implemented in this assessment. Parameters and weights for the CanadaSHM6 seismic source models are taken from [@Kolaj2023]. Period- and model-dependent weights for the final suite of 17 NGA-East GMMs are implemented as recommended by [@Goulet2018].

## 7.0 SEISMIC HAZARD RESULTS

The PSHA calculations were carried out using the software OpenQuake v3.16.3 for the Louvicourt TSF site located at 48.135ºN latitude and 77.595ºW longitude and for a VS30 of 1,853 m/s to represent the site ground conditions of the local bedrock. Analyses were completed for a minimum earthquake magnitude of Mw 4.8 (the
## 5. Regional Seismic Setting

### 5.1 Seismicity

The earthquake catalogue has been compiled by Earthquakes Canada for the entire Canadian landmass from historical records dating back to 1627. Earthquake locations have been plotted and are shown below. A magnitude-frequency distribution has been developed from the catalogue data and is included as an indication of the annual rate of occurrence of earthquakes of Magnitude 5.0 and above. For the purposes of the site seismic hazard assessment, the catalogue data has been screened based on distance from the Site and a representative earthquake recurrence relationship has been developed. The development of this relationship is described in the following sections.

Figure 5 and Figure 6 show the epicentral distribution of earthquake events in the region surrounding the Site. Figure 5 shows all recorded events within 1,000 km of the Site and Figure 6 shows events within 500 km of the Site. Events with magnitudes of M > 5.0 are labelled on both of these figures. These figures have been developed using the earthquake database from the Geological Survey of Canada. Epicentre locations may not be spatially precise (particularly for historic events) but a representation of the regional pattern of seismicity is provided by these plots.

Two clusters of events are located to the south and southwest of the Site at distances of approximately 900 and 1,000 km respectively. The southern cluster is characteristic of the western Quebec seismic zone (WQSZ) and the southwest cluster is characteristic of the Charlevoix seismic zone (CSZ) [@Adams1989; @Adams1991].

A small number of earthquakes have been recorded within approximately 100 km of the Site, including three events with M 3.5 to 4.0 and seven events with M 3.0 to 3.5.

The magnitude-frequency distribution for all events larger than M > 2.0 in the 1,000 km and 500 km radii zones are presented as Figure 7 and Figure 8. These plots include the annual rate of occurrence of earthquakes larger than a given magnitude. For the 1,000 km plot, the data show that earthquakes with magnitudes of M 5.0 and M 6.0 occur at a mean annual rate of approximately once every 1.6 years and 8 years respectively within the 1,000 km screening region. For the 500 km plot, the rates for M 5.0 and M 6.0 events are approximately once every 4 years and 30 years respectively.
# 4. Design Parameters

## 4.1 Static analyses

The reference ground profile adopted for the static design is based on the available data. The data are reported in section 3 of this document. Mechanical characteristic assumed for the site soils are set forth in Table 2.

| Stratum | γ (kN/m³) | c' (kPa) | φ' (°) | c (kPa) | φ (°) |
|---------|-----------|----------|---------|---------|--------|
| Fill / Loose sand | 18 | 0 | 30 | 0 | 30 |
| Clay | 19 | 0 | 28 | 60 | 0 |
| Compact sand | 20 | 0 | 33 | 0 | 33 |
| Bedrock | 27 | 1000 | 45 | 1000 | 45 |

**Table 2.** Geotechnical properties of the site soils

## 4.2 Seismic analyses

According to CSA S6-14, the seismic design is represented by a target spectrum that takes into account factors such as soil profile type (based on average shear wave velocity of the upper 30 m, V_S30), structural system, design life and type of infrastructures (road, rail, water pipeline, etc.) (CSA, 2014). For the purpose of this study, the site specific seismic hazard assessment has been conducted which is based on a probabilistic procedure. The site specific spectrum reflects the seismic environment of the site and allows the effects of site-specific characteristic such as the non-linear response (stiffness variation and hysteresis damping) on the ground motion.

The non-linear response of the soils, during an earthquake, can be easily represented by reduced shear modulus and added hysteresis damping (not to be confused with Raleigh damping). The variation of shear modulus and damping according to the strain level can be described by normalized curves of modulus reduction versus cyclic shear strain amplitude, G/G_max-γ, and damping ratio versus cyclic shear strain amplitude, D-γ. Recommended G/G_max-γ and D-γ curves for cohesionless and cohesive soils have been published by many authors (e.g., [@Seed1970]; [@Vucetic1991]). Figure 13 and Figure 14 present the G/G_max - γ and D - γ curves used in this study for the sands and clays. The curves proposed by [@Seed1970] were used for the sands, which roughly corresponds to average plasticity index of 30 for cohesive soils, as per the material characteristics provided. The unit weight and initial shear modulus used for the seismic analysis are summarized in Table 3.

| Stratum | Depth (m) | Shear Modulus G_max (MPa) | Unit weight γ (kN/m³) | V_s (m/s) |
|---------|-----------|---------------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| Loose sand | 0 - 5 | 46 - 56 | 17 | 160 - 180 |
| Clay | 5 - 30 | 46 - 104 | 19 | 155 - 235 |
| Compact sand | 30 - 80 | 124 - 250 | 20 | 250 - 360 |
| Bedrock | >80 | 1200 | 27 | 670 |

**Table 3.** Dynamic properties of the site soils

The main parameters needed to define the site and bedrock motions are the horizontal Peak Ground Acceleration at rock outcrop (PGA_M), the spectral values at 0.2 s (S_a(0.2s)) and at 1.0 s (S_a(1.0s)). For the Louvicourt site, the values are listed in Table 4. The seismic hazards parameters correspond to a 2 % probability of exceedance in 50 years. It's a return period of 2475 years.

**Table 4.** Site and bedrock parameters, 2 % in 50 years

| Parameters | PGA (g) | S_a(0.2s) (g) | S_a(1.0s) (g) |
|------------|---------|----------------|----------------|
| Bedrock | 0.052 | 0.130 | 0.026 |
| Soil surface | 0.053 | 0.090 | 0.042 |
## Site Response Analysis

The geomorphology of the study area is important for ground motion hazard assessment, because seismic waves travelling up through rock and soil layers may be amplified by the low rigidity of sediment materials. The extent to which ground motion amplification may occur is captured by site amplification functions that have been developed globally through site response studies. The study site is located in the Eastern Canadian Shield (ECS), a geological region in which the rock geological setting is characterized by Archean and Proterozoic outcropping and sub-outcropping igneous and metamorphic rocks with an average shear-wave velocity of 3,000 m/s [@Atkinson2004a]. The thin overburden on top of the ECS bedrock presents at times complex layering, with a mean sub-surface shear wave velocity of 760 m/s over the top 30 m [@Atkinson2004a]. This is within the NEHRP range that correspond to very hard rock (Site class A, VS30 >1500 m/s). The Site class A is the reference site class in [@Adams2015] (6th generation seismic hazard maps of Canada) and no correction for site amplification is required for the sites of interest. The evaluation of site amplification in ECS is an active area of research [@Molnar2018; @Molnar2020] and further refinement may be expected, which would result in a reduction of ground motion [@Molnar2020]. The estimated adjustments are lower than the inherent uncertainties in the GMPE models and therefore negligible.

## Seismic Hazard Calculations

The seismic hazard calculations were done following the probabilistic seismic hazard analysis formulation (PSHA) introduced by [@Cornell1968] and employed in several national and regional seismic hazard analysis models, including the seismic hazard model of Canada [@Adams2015]. PSHA provides an analytical framework to combine information on seismic sources, their rates of earthquake occurrence, and the spatial distribution of ground motion intensity to compute the rate of exceeding ground motion at a site of interest. This hazard computation can be done for various levels of ground shaking (i.e., PGA or SA at various periods) to develop hazard curves. Seismic hazard curves, which represent the relationship between the exceedance rate and the level of ground shaking, are computed for the site of interest. In addition, seismic disaggregation analysis is conducted to understand the relative contribution of different seismic sources to the total seismic hazard.

The PSHA computations were done using the OpenQuake Engine [@Pagani2014], an open-source software for seismic hazard and risk analysis, developed by the Global Earthquake Model Foundation (GEM). The seismic hazard computations are done at a return period of 2,475 years for the two target sites: Station #1 and Station #2 of the Louvicourt Mine. The hazard is presented separately for each target site, following national and international guidelines for earthquake engineering of major structures [@NBCC2015; @CSA2019].

The occurrence of earthquakes is an uncertain process. However, the likelihood of different magnitude earthquakes occurring across the study area over a given time window can be inferred from the statistics of past seismicity. To quantify future seismicity, we rely on the magnitude-frequency relationships expressed by the Gutenberg-Richter power law and the Poisson model of earthquake occurrence. The Gutenberg-Richter power law describes the power-law relationship between magnitude and the annual rate of earthquakes:

log10 N(m) = a - b * m

where N(m) is the rate of earthquakes with magnitude greater than or equal to m, a represents the logarithm of earthquake productivity, and b (the b-value) is the relative ratio of smaller earthquakes to larger earthquakes, usually constrained close to 1 [@Gutenberg1944]. The Gutenberg-Richter b-value and a-value can be estimated using the maximum-likelihood method of [@Weichert1980]. For the Fort Albany study area, we analyzed earthquake productivity over a 250 km radius using the declustered catalog from Section 3. We trimmed the data according to annual completeness estimates (Table 1) to generate an evenly weighted dataset which can be fed to the Weichert maximum-likelihood algorithm. Based on the trimmed data, we estimate a b-value of 0.86 ± 0.10 and an a-value of 2.95. These values produce an active rate of approximately 0.0020 (or 1/500) M ≥ 5 earthquake per year within the 250 km study area, and a 0.00004 (1/25,000) rate of M ≥ 7 per year.

Based on the derived a and b-values, we estimate the expected rate of earthquake occurrence at different magnitudes in Table 3. These rates are calculated for the entire 250 km radius study area, not specific to the site. The expected recurrence intervals in Table 3 show that, on average, a M ≥ 5 earthquake is expected every 500 years in the study area, and a M ≥ 6 every ~4,000 years. Although M ≥ 7 earthquakes are possible, they are extremely rare, with expected recurrence intervals on the order of 25,000 years.

**Table 3.** Expected magnitude-frequency statistics within 250 km of Fort Albany, derived from regional seismicity and magnitude-frequency relationships.

| Magnitude Range | Expected Annual Rate | Expected Recurrence Interval (years) |
|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| M ≥ 5.0 | 0.0020 | 500 |
| M ≥ 5.5 | 0.0009 | 1,100 |
| M ≥ 6.0 | 0.00043 | 2,300 |
| M ≥ 6.5 | 0.00020 | 5,000 |
| M ≥ 7.0 | 0.00009 | 11,000 |
| M ≥ 7.5 | 0.00004 | 25,000 |

The Poisson model is commonly used in seismic hazard analysis to model the temporal distribution of earthquakes. Under this assumption, earthquakes occur independently and randomly in time, with a constant annual rate λ. The probability P of observing n events in a time window t is:

P(n, t) = (λt)^n * e^(-λt) / n!

Using this model, we can calculate the probability of at least one earthquake exceeding a given magnitude within a certain time frame. For example, using the M ≥ 5 annual rate (λ = 0.0020), the probability of experiencing at least one M ≥ 5 earthquake within 50 years (a typical design lifetime) is:

P(n ≥ 1, t = 50) = 1 - P(n = 0, t = 50) = 1 - e^(-0.0020 × 50) = 1 - e^(-0.10) ≈ 0.095 or ~9.5%

Similarly, the probability of at least one M ≥ 6 earthquake in 50 years is approximately 2.1%, and for M ≥ 7, it is approximately 0.04%.

These probabilities indicate that while moderate earthquakes (M ≥ 5) have a reasonable likelihood of occurrence during typical infrastructure design lifetimes, larger earthquakes (M ≥ 6 or M ≥ 7) remain relatively unlikely but cannot be entirely dismissed from hazard considerations.
