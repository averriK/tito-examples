## Executive summary
The SRK Ground-Motion Intensity Model is an integrated ensemble of ground-motion prediction equations implemented through three region-specific logic trees, corresponding to GEM, USGS and Canadian SHM6 seismic hazard configurations. Conceptually it is treated as a single intensity model, with a common treatment of active shallow crust and subduction environments and three alternative ensembles for stable continental crust. The model combines modern global and regional GMPEs for active shallow crust, subduction interface and intraslab tectonic regimes with contemporary representations of epistemic uncertainty in stable continental regions derived from NGA-East and related studies. Weights within each branch set sum to unity and are chosen to preserve the balance between legacy national models and more recent SRK developments, while ensuring consistency across the three logic trees.

## Logic-tree architecture
The intensity model is represented in OpenQuake by three NRML logic trees: a GEM configuration, a USGS CEUS configuration and a Canadian SHM6 configuration. For active shallow crust and all subduction regimes the three trees share identical branch sets, so that for these tectonic environments the SRK model behaves as a single, common ensemble irrespective of which tree is used. The only differentiation between the three trees occurs in the stable continental crust branch, where each tree retains the regional ensemble required by its parent hazard model.

Active shallow crust is handled by a single branch set (ASC_ALL) comprising nine GMPEs. Four branches correspond to Canadian SHM6 implementations of NGA-West2 models, four correspond to global NGA-West2 models as used in GEM, and three correspond to recent SRK active-crust models. All nine branches participate with similar weights, with the Canadian and GEM NGA-West2 branches and two of the SRK models each carrying a weight of 0.11 and the remaining SRK model a weight of 0.12, giving a total weight of 1.0.

Subduction interface motions are handled by a common branch set (SI_ALL) with eight GMPEs. Four branches correspond to interface models used in the Canadian SHM6 hazard model for Cascadia and other subduction zones, and four branches correspond to recent SRK global interface models. All eight interface branches carry equal weights of 0.125. Intraslab motions are split into two depth regimes, represented by separate branch sets SLAB30_ALL and SLAB55_ALL for shallower and deeper effective slab depths, respectively. Each of these branch sets contains seven GMPEs; a Canadian SHM6 implementation of the Abrahamson et al. (2015) intraslab model carries a weight of 0.16, while two additional Canadian SHM6 slab models and four modern SRK slab models each carry a weight of 0.14.

Stable continental crust is handled differently in each of the three trees. The GEM tree uses a compact three-branch SRK ensemble for generic stable continental and cratonic regions. The USGS tree uses the full NGA-East USGS logic tree, which consists of seventeen "Sammons" branches and six "seed" models representing central and eastern North American ground-motion behaviour. The SHM6 tree uses the Canadian sixth-generation national hazard model stable-crust logic tree, which combines thirteen NGA-East based submodels and three branches based on the Atkinson and Adams (2013) model with high, central and low median levels. Across all three trees, the SRK intensity model therefore represents stable continental epistemic uncertainty using regionally appropriate ensembles, while maintaining a common treatment of active crust and subduction.

## Stable continental crust component
The stable continental crust component of the SRK intensity model consists of three alternative ensembles implemented in parallel, each tailored to a different regional context yet sharing a similar conceptual basis in NGA-East and related studies.

### GEM SCC ensemble
Within the GEM logic tree, stable continental crust (SCC) is represented by a three-branch SRK ensemble. One branch uses the ESHM20Craton model derived from the European Seismic Hazard Model 2020, which characterises ground motions in European and adjacent cratonic regions [@DanciuEtAl2021]. A second branch uses the Rietbrock and Edwards (2019) model, which was calibrated for stable crust in the United Kingdom and northern Europe [@RietbrockEdwards2019]. A third branch uses the Shahjouei and Pezeshk (2016) model, developed for central and eastern North America and representative of broader stable continental behaviour [@ShahjoueiPezeshk2016]. The corresponding logic-tree weights are 0.34 for ESHM20Craton, and 0.33 for each of Rietbrock–Edwards and Shahjouei–Pezeshk, such that all three branches together form a balanced, modern representation of SCC motions suitable for GEM-style applications.

### USGS NGA-East ensemble
Within the USGS logic tree, stable continental crust motions are represented by the full NGA-East USGS ensemble as documented in the USGS central and eastern United States hazard model [@USGSNGAEast; @GouletEtAl2018]. This ensemble consists of seventeen "Sammons" branches, each representing a weighted combination of NGA-East candidate models derived using the Sammons mapping and averaging procedure, and six seed models corresponding to individual NGA-East candidate GMPEs (for example models by Graizer, Frankel, Yenier and Atkinson, and Pezeshk and co-authors).

### Canadian SHM6 SCC ensemble
Within the SHM6 logic tree, stable continental crust motions are represented by the logic tree from the Sixth Generation Seismic Hazard Model of Canada. Thirteen branches correspond to submodels of CanadaSHM6_StableCrust_NGAEast, each tied to a different NGA-East realisation and carrying unconditional weights that sum to 0.5. These branches also have intensity-measure-specific weights, which allow the relative contribution of each submodel to vary with spectral period, reflecting the period-dependent epistemic uncertainty inferred from NGA-East. The remaining 0.5 of the SCC weight is allocated to three branches based on the Atkinson and Adams (2013) stable-crust model for eastern Canada, representing high, central and low median levels with unconditional weights of 0.15, 0.25 and 0.10, respectively. This ensemble therefore combines NGA-East based models with national Canadian practice in a single stable-crust logic tree.

## Active shallow crust component
The active shallow crust component of the SRK intensity model is defined by a single branch set, ASC_ALL, which is shared across the GEM, USGS and SHM6 logic trees. This branch set contains nine GMPEs that together represent current knowledge of ground motions in active shallow crustal regions, combining NGA-West2 models as implemented in the Canadian SHM6 and GEM hazard models with more recent SRK developments.

Four branches correspond to the Canadian SHM6 implementations of the NGA-West2 active-crust models of Abrahamson et al. (2014), Boore et al. (2014), Campbell and Bozorgnia (2014) and Chiou and Youngs (2014). These models were originally calibrated for shallow crustal earthquakes in western North America and other tectonically active regions, using the NGA-West2 strong-motion dataset, and have been re-parameterised in SHM6 for application to Canadian active crust. Each of these four branches carries a weight of 0.11.

Two additional branches correspond to the GEM use of the NGA-West2 models by Abrahamson et al. (2014) and Chiou and Youngs (2014) as generic active-crust predictors for Africa and other regions where dedicated regional GMPEs are not available. These branches also each carry a weight of 0.11. Together, the six NGA-West2-based branches therefore contribute 0.66 of the total active-crust weight and provide continuity with existing national and global practice.

The remaining three branches correspond to modern SRK active-crust models. The Kotha et al. (2020) model represents site- and region-adaptive active-crust ground motions in Europe and the Mediterranean region, based on a pan-European strong-motion dataset and a hierarchical modelling framework. The Boore et al. (2020) model represents an updated active-crust GMPE building on the NGA-West2 work, with revisions to scaling, site response and epistemic uncertainty treatment. The Hassani and Atkinson (2020) model provides a global active-crust predictor with explicit region-to-region adjustments and a modern treatment of aleatory variability. Within ASC_ALL the Kotha and Boore models each carry a weight of 0.11, while the Hassani and Atkinson model carries a weight of 0.12. These three branches therefore contribute 0.34 of the total active-crust weight and provide a modern complement to the NGA-West2 family.

## Subduction interface component
The subduction interface component of the SRK intensity model is represented by the SI_ALL branch set, common to all three logic trees. This set contains eight GMPEs that together represent both regional Cascadia practice and more recent global subduction developments.

Four branches correspond to the interface models used in the Canadian SHM6 hazard model. One uses the Abrahamson et al. (2015) subduction interface model, originally developed for global subduction zones with emphasis on Japan and the Americas. A second uses the Atkinson and Macias (2009) interface model, calibrated primarily for Mexican interface earthquakes. A third uses the Ghofrani and Atkinson (2014) model for Cascadia interface events, which integrates regional strong-motion and geodetic constraints. A fourth uses the Zhao et al. (2006) interface model, originally developed for Japanese subduction earthquakes but widely applied in other regions including Cascadia. Each of these four Canadian SHM6 interface branches carries a weight of 0.125.

The remaining four branches correspond to modern SRK global subduction interface models. The Abrahamson and Gülerce (2020) interface model provides a global empirical description of subduction interface motions using an expanded worldwide database. The Kuehn et al. (2020) interface model adopts a Bayesian hierarchical formulation to represent regional variability and epistemic uncertainty in subduction interface scaling. The Parker et al. (2020) interface model offers an alternative global parameterisation with particular attention to high-magnitude scaling and site effects. The Si et al. (2020) interface model provides an additional global subduction interface predictor derived from an updated strong-motion dataset. Within SI_ALL each of these SRK interface branches carries a weight of 0.125, so that the Canadian SHM6 and SRK global models each account for half of the subduction interface epistemic weight.

## Subduction intraslab components
Intraslab ground motions are represented by two separate branch sets that distinguish shallower and deeper effective slab depths. The SLAB30_ALL set corresponds to subduction intraslab events with effective depths of around 30 km, while the SLAB55_ALL set corresponds to deeper events with effective depths around 55 km. Both branch sets are common to the GEM, USGS and SHM6 logic trees and have identical compositions, differing only in the specific Canadian SHM6 slab implementations used for each depth range.

Within SLAB30_ALL, one branch uses the Canadian SHM6 implementation of the Abrahamson et al. (2015) slab model for shallower intraslab events, carrying a logic-tree weight of 0.16. Two further branches use Canadian SHM6 implementations of the Garcia et al. (2005) and Zhao et al. (2006) intraslab models for the 30 km depth regime, each carrying a weight of 0.14. The remaining four branches use the SRK global slab models of Abrahamson and Gülerce (2020), Kuehn et al. (2020), Parker et al. (2020) and Si et al. (2020), all evaluated for intraslab conditions, with each branch also carrying a weight of 0.14. Together these seven branches span a wide range of global and regional slab calibrations, while maintaining a balanced weight distribution.

Within SLAB55_ALL the structure is analogous. The Abrahamson et al. (2015) Canadian SHM6 slab implementation for deeper intraslab events carries a weight of 0.16. The Garcia et al. (2005) and Zhao et al. (2006) Canadian SHM6 slab implementations for deeper effective depths each carry a weight of 0.14. The four SRK global slab models by Abrahamson and Gülerce (2020), Kuehn et al. (2020), Parker et al. (2020) and Si et al. (2020) are again included with weights of 0.14 each. This construction ensures that the same family of global slab models contributes to both depth regimes, while preserving the Canadian SHM6 representation of Cascadia and related regional data.
