## Reitfontein Fault [INCOMPLETE]

Based on comprehensive analysis of knowledge base sources and external validation against peer-reviewed literature, the following conclusions address the six research questions regarding epistemic uncertainty in PSHA parameterization for the Reitfontein Fault:

**Fault Activity Classification:** The Reitfontein Fault is best classified as a paleoseismic structure rather than a neotectonic fault. It lacks geological or geomorphological evidence of movement in the last 35,000 years and shows only minor present-day seismic activity. The characterization as an active fault with assigned slip rate of 1 m/Myr represents a conservative engineering assumption rather than empirically demonstrated activity.

**Evidence for Holocene Activity:** There is no evidence in the analyzed sources that permits affirmation of Reitfontein Fault activity in the last 35,000 years. The absence of paleoseismic investigations represents a significant data gap, but the lack of observable neotectonic features suggests that if the fault has been active in this timeframe, the activity rate is at or below detection limits of standard paleoseismic methods.

## Benchmark [INCOMPLETE]

Los valores de PGA obtenidos por SCR son muy altos para la region
El modelo de PSHA de SCR esta muy bien desarrollado y sighe las reglas del estado del arte en la estimacion del PSHA. Luego, el modelo no sugiere tener errores 

La hipotesis principal en las diferencias observadas entre los valores de PGA de SCR y los modelos de referencia de la region, es el tratamiento epistemico que se le ha asignado a la falla de Reitfontein Fault. Se ha cosndeisdaro esta falla como neotectonica y se le han asignado cuna combinacion de parametros de productivodad (GR) SLIP RATES, Y TAMANOMAXIMO DE RUPTURA (MMAX) QUE incorporaron intensidades muy elevadas en periodos de retorno iguales o menores a 10,000 anos.




## Recommendations


**3. Logic Tree for Mmax:** In a logic tree for maximum magnitude, the originally assumed value of Mmax = 7.2 should receive low to moderate weight. A multi-branch structure is recommended: Mmax = 6.5, 7.0, 7.2, and 7.5. This distribution reflects cratonic constraints (Mcmax = 6.0 for Archean cratons), the absence of neotectonic evidence, comparison with historical seismicity (Mw 6.2 maximum), and recognition of paleoseismic potential demonstrated elsewhere in South Africa.

**4. Slip Rate Range and Logic Tree:** The compatible slip rate range for a fault of the Reitfontein type in a Stable Continental Region is 0.1-20 m/Myr. A logic tree structure should include branches at 0.1 m/Myr, 1.0 m/Myr, 5.0 m/Myr, and 20.0 m/Myr. The current assumption of 1.0 m/Myr represents a conservative minimum for faults included in hazard models, while acknowledging substantial probability that actual slip rates are lower.

**5. Return Period Assessment:** The slip rate range of 0.1-20 m/Myr mathematically permits seismic movements in return periods less than 1/10,000 years. However, this mathematical possibility is strongly constrained by: absence of neotectonic evidence contradicting sustained slip rates $\geq$ 1 m/Myr [@Mmax2023], and episodic behavior characteristic of SCR faults [@Mmax2023a]. For practical hazard assessment at return periods <10,000 years, smaller magnitude events (M 5.5-6.5) will dominate the hazard rather than approach to Mmax.

**6. Gutenberg-Richter Parameters:** The appropriate b-value range for the Reitfontein Fault is 0.95-1.60, with central estimate 1.10. A revised logic tree structure should include branches at b = 0.95, 1.10, 1.30, and 1.60. This distribution places dominant weight on the value most consistent with regional tectonic seismicity (b = 1.10) while eliminating the physically implausible b = 1.99 branch from the current PSHA [@Marzocchi2014].

**Overall Assessment:** The assignment of Mmax = 7.2 with slip rate 1 m/Myr and return periods <1/10,000 years represents a conservative engineering approach appropriate for safety-critical infrastructure but likely exceeds the realistic seismogenic potential of the Reitfontein Fault. The proposed logic tree structures for Mmax, slip rate, and b-value provide a framework for capturing epistemic uncertainty that acknowledges both the need for conservatism in critical facility design and the substantial scientific evidence suggesting lower seismic potential than currently modeled.

The very long return period hazard ($\geq$ 10,000 years) and deterministic scenarios will be sensitive to Mmax selection, and the multi-branch logic tree approach properly captures this uncertainty without over-weighting scenarios that are inconsistent with the cratonic tectonic setting and lack of neotectonic evidence.
