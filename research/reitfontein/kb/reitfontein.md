## Reitfontein Fault's characterization


The South African seismotectonic setting presents particular challenges for PSHA due to the superposition of natural tectonic seismicity, mining-induced seismicity, and the long recurrence intervals characteristic of stable continental regions (SCR). The absence of a comprehensive fault catalog providing systematic slip rate and $M_{\max}$ data for all South African neotectonic and paleoseismic faults creates substantial knowledge gaps. This section addresses questions regarding the seismogenic characterization of the Reitfontein Fault to inform the development of a logic tree for PSHA parameters, particularly the viability of an $M_{\max} = 7.2$ event with a 64 km rupture occurring within a return period less than 1/10,000 years.

### Neotectonic Evidence

A neotectonic fault is defined as one that has accommodated displacement under the current crustal stress regime. In South Africa, this regime has existed since roughly 40 to 11 million years ago. Active faults are typically defined as those that have produced historical earthquakes or evidence movement within the last 35,000 years [@Crone1997]. There is no geological or geomorphological evidence of neotectonic activity on the Reitfontein Fault. Documented surface ruptures, displaced young sediments, geomorphic signs of recent faulting, or other markers consistent with the standard definition of an active fault are absent. The lack of paleoseismic investigations remains a significant data gap. Singh et al. (2009) reported only minor present-day seismic activity along the fault and specifically identified the Reitfontein Fault as requiring reassessment to determine current activity, highlighting the uncertainty of its active status. Simply listing the fault as needing further study does not confirm active neotectonic classification.

Therefore, the Reitfontein Fault does not meet established criteria for neotectonic classification but appears to be a paleoseismic feature with limited contemporary activity. Its designation as an active fault with a slip rate of 1 m/Myr is best viewed as a conservative engineering assumption rather than a proven fact. It is most accurately described as a paleoseismic structure that may occasionally reactivate under current stress conditions, but for which sustained neotectonic activity is not substantiated. In stable continental regions, faults may behave episodically, with ground-rupturing events recurring at intervals of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years. Paleoseismic studies stress the risks of relying solely on instrumental records in settings with 10,000-100,000+ year recurrence intervals. Lack of recent activity does not rule out the possibility of rare, episodic large earthquakes in these settings, but neither does it prove their occurrence in the last 35,000 years [@Crone1997].



### Rupture Size $(M_{max}=7.2)$

The regional $M_{\max}$ context from seismicity models employed in the South Deep PSHA study reveals substantial variability in maximum magnitude assumptions, which reflects epistemic uncertainty in stable continental region seismogenic potential. The PSHA employs three different earthquake recurrence models: EZ-FRISK's Africa model, the Global Earthquake Model's (GEM) South Africa (ZAF) model, and a smoothed seismicity model developed specifically for the study  Each model assigns different $M_{\max}$ values to area sources based on tectonic setting and seismicity characteristics. 

 Current South African PSHA models assign $M_{\max}$ values ranging from 5.3-6.3 for most regional zones. The EZ-FRISK Africa model assigns $M_{\max}$ values of 7.23 to the Drakensberg zone and 7.0 to the Kaapvaal zone. The GEM ZAF ZEBED zone has $M_{\max}$ values of 5.28 (weight 0.45), 5.53 (weight 0.35), and 5.93 (weight 0.20). The  EZ-FRISK Drakensberg $M_{\max} = 7.23$,  exceeds the more conservative GEM ZAF ZEBED zone estimates.

The largest recorded earthquake in South Africa was the Ceres event of September 29, 1969, with magnitude $M_w$ 6.2 [@Durrheim2013]. This represents a 1.0 magnitude unit difference (32 times difference in seismic moment release) from the assigned $M_{\max} = 7.2$. The $M_{\max} = 7.2$ represents an unusually high value for the South African stable continental region.



### Rupture Length

The maximum credible earthquake magnitude $M_{\max}$ is not constrained by seismicity data but has been estimated from the tectonic setting by each earthquake recurrence model's authors  The $M_{\max}$ of 7.2 has been determined using the Wells and Coppersmith (1994) relationship for a 64 km fault length [@WellsCoppersmith1994]. Log-linear regressions between earthquake magnitude and surface rupture length showed strong correlations with standard deviations of 0.25 to 0.35 magnitude units [@WellsCoppersmith1994]. This uncertainty range implies that for a 64 km fault, magnitudes could reasonably range from approximately 6.85 to 7.55 based solely on scaling relationship uncertainty.  The methodology determines also minimum magnitude $M_{\min}$ by subtracting a value from $M_{\max}$ that depends on the magnitude range: for $M_{\max}$ between 6.5 and 7.4, $M_{\min} = M_{\max} - 1.5$, yielding a range of 5.0 to 5.9  This means the Reitfontein Fault with $M_{\max} = 7.2$ would have $M_{\min} = 5.7$. 

However, critical caveats apply to this calculation. Not all mapped fault lengths necessarily represent seismogenic lengths capable of rupturing in a single earthquake. Additionally, stable continental region earthquakes may exhibit different scaling relationships than active tectonic region earthquakes. The 64 km rupture length assumption is justified as a conservative estimate based on mapped extent, though actual seismogenic length may be considerably shorter.

The 64 km rupture length assumption appears to be justified as a conservative estimate based on the mapped extent of the Reitfontein Fault, though the actual seismogenic length may be considerably shorter. The fault is documented as spanning 64 km, dipping to the north, and being oriented approximately east-west  For a 64 km fault length and normal mechanism, the Wells and Coppersmith (1994) scaling relationship yields $M_{\max} = 7.2$  Wells and Coppersmith (1994) developed empirical relationships among moment magnitude, surface rupture length, subsurface rupture length, and rupture area based on a global compilation of historical earthquakes [@WellsCoppersmith1994].

 > Length-based $M_{\max}$ estimation provides an upper bound on potential earthquake size but does not address the probability that such earthquakes can actually occur within relevant timeframes.

### Slip Rate Uncertainty

No slip rate has been published for the Reitfontein Fault. The assigned value of 1 m/Myr represents a conservative engineering assumption rather than empirical measurement . When slip rates are not quantified, they are estimated based on all other available data. For bedrock faults that do not show evidence of movement in the last 10 million years but are included due to favorable orientation, a low uplift rate of 1 m/Myr is assigned. Some of the more active faults in South Africa have slip rates on the order of 200 m/Myr, such as the Kango Fault, which is 200 times higher than Reitfontein's assigned rate yet produces similar maximum magnitudes [@Viola2016]. The Pretorius Fault is also assigned a slip rate of 1 m/Myr in the absence of published estimates, placing both faults at the lower end of the slip-rate spectrum for active structures in South Africa .

> The absence of neotectonic evidence combined with the very low assigned slip rate (1 m/Myr) suggests that the Reitfontein Fault's seismic potential may be substantially overestimated in the current PSHA. 

### Mining Induced Seismicity

The largest mining-related seismic event ever to occur in South Africa registered magnitude 5.3 on March 9, 2005 [@MiningNews2015].  The PSHA study excludes events suspected of being mining-related with magnitudes less than M4.0 to minimize the influence of induced seismicity. Mining-induced seismicity falls into two main categories: collapsing of highly stressed rock masses and shear along geological planes of weakness. The mechanism by which mining influences seismicity involves stress redistribution due to excavation, resulting in fracture initiation and movement along pre-existing planes.

Mining in the Witwatersrand Basin currently approaches depths of 4,000 meters, while in stable continental regions with thick lithosphere, seismogenic depths typically extend to 15-25 km. The Reitfontein Fault is located 43 km from the South Deep Mine site, which is substantially farther than the Pretorius Fault (18 km). Therefore, mining-induced seismicity is highly unlikely to trigger rupture of the entire 64 km Reitfontein Fault, though it may contribute to stress perturbations that reactivate segments of the structure. The large distance (43 km) and the depth difference between mining operations ($\leq$ 4 km) and seismogenic depths (5-16 km for natural events) suggest that Reitfontein Fault seismicity would be primarily tectonic rather than mining-induced.
