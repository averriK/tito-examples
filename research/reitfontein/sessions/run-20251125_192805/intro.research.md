# Introduction

## Background

The South Deep Gold Mine operates two sites of interest: the Doornpoort (New Facility) located at 27.4602°S latitude and 27.6501°E longitude, and the South Deep (Four Old Dams) at 27.4172°S latitude and 27.6734°E longitude in South Africa [KB:psha_deep_south.md]. SLR Consulting was requested by South Deep Gold Mine to develop a site-specific Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Assessment for the South Deep tailings storage facilities [KB:psha_deep_south.md]. This exercise was conducted to conform with Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management requirements and to provide an improved site-specific seismic characterization compared to that adopted in the 2008/2009 design of the Doornpoort TSF [KB:psha_deep_south.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph accurately reproduces factual information about the South Deep Gold Mine location, the purpose of the PSHA study, and the two specific objectives stated in the SRC report. The coordinates, facility names, organizational relationships (SLR requested by South Deep), and specific objectives (GISTM compliance and improved characterization over 2008/2009 design) are all directly supported by [KB:psha_deep_south.md] content. The KB document explicitly states these facts in the initial pages and executive summary.]

The Seismology Research Centre conducted the PSHA work, producing a report entitled "South Deep Gold Mine, Seismic hazard Assessment – June 2025 (Draft Report)" [KB:psha_deep_south.md]. The study focused on earthquake hazard resulting from ground shaking, excluding secondary seismic hazards such as surface rupture, liquefaction, landslides, seiche, tsunami, and subsidence [KB:psha_deep_south.md]. Seismic hazard calculations were conducted using the equally weighted average of three seismic source models: the EZ-FRISK Africa model, the Global Earthquake Model's Africa (ZAF) model, and a smoothed seismicity model developed by SRC staff member Russell Cuthbertson [KB:psha_deep_south.md]. All three models incorporated fault sources [KB:psha_deep_south.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately summarizes the methodological approach of the SRC PSHA study. The KB document [KB:psha_deep_south.md] explicitly confirms: (1) SRC authorship and report title with June 2025 date, (2) focus on ground shaking with exclusion of secondary hazards listed, (3) use of three equally-weighted seismic source models with the specific names provided, (4) inclusion of fault sources in all three models. These statements appear in both the executive summary and introduction sections of the source document with consistent terminology and details.]

The study utilized five Ground Motion Prediction Equations comprising two models appropriate for active shallow crustal regions (Boore et al., 2014; Chiou & Youngs, 2014) and three models suited to stable continental regions (Atkinson & Boore, 2006; Goulet et al., 2018; Pezeshk et al., 2011) [KB:psha_deep_south.md]. Probabilistic hazard curves were developed for peak ground acceleration and spectral response with a 5% damping ratio, applying a minimum considered magnitude of 5.0 [KB:psha_deep_south.md]. A $V_{s30}$ value of 600 m/s was used for the computation of ground motion recurrence results presented in the report [KB:psha_deep_south.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph accurately reports the ground motion modeling methodology from [KB:psha_deep_south.md]. The KB document explicitly lists all five GMPEs with their authors and publication years in the executive summary and Section 5, confirms the 5% damping ratio and minimum magnitude 5.0 in multiple locations, and states the $V_{s30}$ = 600 m/s assumption consistently throughout. The classification of two models for active shallow crust and three for stable continental regions matches the source document's characterization. All technical parameters and citations are directly verifiable from the KB content.]

For the Doornpoort site, the peak ground acceleration for a 475-year return period (10% probability of exceedance in 50 years) was estimated at 0.33 g, while the PGA for a 10,000-year return period was calculated as 1.3 g, assuming a $V_{s30}$ value of 600 m/s [KB:psha_deep_south.md]. Previous assessments using different methodologies and input data produced PGA estimates ranging from 0.1 g to 0.55 g for the 475-year return period [KB:psha_deep_south.md]. The PGA values presented by SRC are considerably higher than the previously adopted PGA values of 0.15 g for the 475-year return period and 0.25 g for the 10,000-year return period [KB:psha_deep_south.md][KB:introduction.md]. There exists a concern that the adoption of these latest SRC PGA values will impact significantly on stability and deformation analyses, which ultimately feeds into the type and extent of any remediation measures that may be required to manage such large ground motions [KB:psha_deep_south.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All quantitative PGA values and associated return periods are directly stated in [KB:psha_deep_south.md] executive summary and introductory letter from SLR. The KB document explicitly provides: 0.33 g for 475-year return period, 1.3 g for 10,000-year return period (new SRC values), the historical range of 0.1 g to 0.55 g for previous studies, and the previously adopted values of 0.15 g and 0.25 g. The concern about impact on stability analyses and remediation measures is directly quoted from the SLR letter in the KB document. [KB:introduction.md] also mentions the discrepancy between SRC values and regional reference values, providing corroborating evidence.]

Given the specialized nature of this subject and the substantial increase in PGA values compared to previously adopted values, SLR recommended that a third-party review be undertaken on the SRC PSHA work [KB:psha_deep_south.md][KB:introduction.md]. The recommended third-party reviewer should comment on the influence of mining-related seismicity on the modelling and the resultant PGA values [KB:psha_deep_south.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph accurately captures the two specific recommendations made by SLR Consulting at the conclusion of their letter in [KB:psha_deep_south.md]. The KB document explicitly states these two recommendations: (1) undertaking a third-party review of the SRC PSHA work, and (2) having the third-party reviewer comment on the influence of mining-related seismicity on modeling and resultant PGA values. [KB:introduction.md] also references the SRC study and discrepancies, providing supporting context for why this review was recommended. Both the specialized nature justification and the focus on mining-related seismicity are directly stated in the source documents.]

## Objectives

The objectives of this work are to conduct a third-party review of the Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Assessment model developed by the Seismology Research Centre, to analyze the possible causes for discrepancies between the seismic intensity values (peak ground acceleration and pseudo-spectral acceleration) provided by SRC and the regional reference values, and to comment on the influence of mining-related seismicity on the modelling and the resultant peak ground acceleration values [KB:introduction.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The objectives statement accurately reflects the three specific objectives listed in [KB:introduction.md]: (1) conduct a third-party review of the PSHA model, (2) analyze possible causes for discrepancies between SRC seismic intensity values (PGA, PSA) and regional reference values, and (3) comment on the influence of mining-related seismicity on modeling and resultant PGA values. These objectives directly correspond to the SLR recommendations stated in [KB:psha_deep_south.md]. The paragraph converts the bullet-point format from the source into a flowing professional sentence structure while preserving all three distinct objectives and their technical content.]
