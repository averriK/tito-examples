  "formatted_text": "# Introduction\n\n## Background\n\nThe South Deep Gold Mine is located in South Africa, with two sites of interest: the Doornpoort (New Facility) at coordinates 27.4602°S, 27.6501°E, and South Deep (Four Old Dams) at 27.4172°S, 27.6734°E [@PSHADeepSouth2025]. SLR Consulting (South Africa) Proprietary Limited was commissioned by South Deep Gold Mine to conduct a site-specific Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Assessment (PSHA) for the South Deep Tailings Storage Facilities (TSFs) [@PSHADeepSouth2025].\n\nThe objectives of the SRC study were twofold: first, to conform with the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM) requirements, and second, to provide an improved site-specific seismic characterization compared to that adopted in the 2008/2009 design of the Doornpoort TSF [@PSHADeepSouth2025]. The seismology work was conducted by the Seismology Research Centre (SRC), a division of ESS Earth Sciences Proprietary Limited, and documented in the report entitled \"South Deep Gold Mine, Seismic hazard Assessment - June 2025 (Draft Report)\" [@PSHADeepSouth2025].\n\nThe PSHA study focused on earthquake hazard resulting from ground shaking, excluding secondary seismic hazards such as surface rupture, liquefaction, landslides, seiche, tsunami, and subsidence [@PSHADeepSouth2025]. Seismic hazard calculations were conducted using the equally weighted average of three seismic source models: the EZ-FRISK Africa model, the Global Earthquake Model's Africa (ZAF) model, and a smoothed seismicity model developed by SRC staff member Russell Cuthbertson [@PSHADeepSouth2025]. All three models incorporated fault sources [@PSHADeepSouth2025].\n\nThe study utilized five Ground Motion Prediction Equations comprising two models appropriate for active shallow crustal regions (Boore et al., 2014; Chiou & Youngs, 2014) and three models suited to stable continental regions (Atkinson & Boore, 2006; Goulet et al., 2018; Pezeshk et al., 2011) [@PSHADeepSouth2025]. Probabilistic hazard curves were developed for peak ground acceleration and spectral response with a 5% damping ratio, applying a minimum considered magnitude of 5.0 [@PSHADeepSouth2025]. A $V_{s30}$ value of 600 m/s was used for the computation of ground motion recurrence results presented in the report [@PSHADeepSouth2025].\n\nFor the Doornpoort site, the SRC PSHA work produced Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) values that were considerably higher than previously adopted values [@PSHADeepSouth2025][@Introduction2025]. The PGA for a 475-year return period (10% probability of exceedance in 50 years) was estimated at 0.33 $g$, while the PGA for a 10,000-year return period was calculated as 1.3 $g$, assuming a $V_{s30}$ value of 600 m/s [@PSHADeepSouth2025]. Previous assessments using different methodologies and input data produced PGA estimates ranging from 0.1 $g$ to 0.55 $g$ for the 475-year return period [@PSHADeepSouth2025]. These values represented a substantial increase from the previously adopted PGA values of 0.15 $g$ for the 475-year return period and 0.25 $g$ for the 10,000-year return period [@PSHADeepSouth2025][@Introduction2025]. The discrepancy between the seismic intensity values (PGA, PSA) provided by SRC and the regional reference values raised concerns regarding the potential impact on stability and deformation analyses, which would ultimately influence the type and extent of remediation measures required to manage such large ground motions [@PSHADeepSouth2025][@Introduction2025].\n\nGiven the specialized nature of the subject and the substantial increase in predicted ground motions compared to previously adopted values, SLR Consulting recommended that a third-party review be undertaken on the SRC PSHA work [@PSHADeepSouth2025][@Introduction2025]. Additionally, SLR recommended that the third-party reviewer should comment on the influence of mining-related seismicity on the modeling and the resultant PGA values [@PSHADeepSouth2025]. These recommendations were motivated by concerns that the adoption of the higher SRC PGA values would significantly impact stability and deformation analyses and quantitative risk assessments (QRAs), likely increasing the scope of possible remedial works [@PSHADeepSouth2025].\n\n## Objectives\n\nThe objectives of this work are to conduct a third-party review of the Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Assessment model developed by the Seismology Research Centre, to analyze the possible causes for discrepancies between the seismic intensity values (peak ground acceleration and pseudo-spectral acceleration) provided by SRC and the regional reference values, and to comment on the influence of mining-related seismicity on the modeling and the resultant peak ground acceleration values [@Introduction2025].",
