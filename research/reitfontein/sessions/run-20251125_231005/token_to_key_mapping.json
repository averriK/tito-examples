These values represented a substantial increase from the previously adopted PGA values of 0.15 g for the 475-year return period and 0.25 g for the 10,000-year return period [@PSHADeepSouth2025]. The discrepancy between the seismic intensity values (PGA, PSA) provided by SRC and the regional reference values raised concerns regarding the potential impact on stability and deformation analyses, which would ultimately influence the type and extent of remediation measures required to manage such large ground motions [@PSHADeepSouth2025][@Introduction2025].",
