# Introduction

## Background

The South Deep Gold Mine is located in South Africa, with two sites of interest: the Doornpoort (New Facility) at coordinates 27.4602°S, 27.6501°E, and South Deep (Four Old Dams) at 27.4172°S, 27.6734°E [KB:psha_deep_south.md]. The mine address is Old Vereeniging Road, Farm Modderfontein, Westonaria, 1780 [KB:psha_deep_south.md]. SLR Consulting (South Africa) Proprietary Limited was commissioned by South Deep Gold Mine to conduct a site-specific Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Assessment (PSHA) for the South Deep Tailings Storage Facilities (TSFs) [KB:psha_deep_south.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All factual details regarding the South Deep Gold Mine location, coordinates, and commissioning of the PSHA study are directly verified from the KB document psha_deep_south.md. The document explicitly states these site coordinates in Section 1.1 (Outline) and provides the mine address in the letter header. The commissioning information is stated in the opening letter dated July 8, 2025.]

The objectives of the SRC study were twofold. First, the PSHA aimed to conform with the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM) requirements [KB:psha_deep_south.md]. Second, the study sought to provide an improved site-specific seismic characterization compared to that adopted in the 2008/2009 design of the Doornpoort TSF [KB:psha_deep_south.md]. The seismology work was conducted by the Seismology Research Centre (SRC), a division of ESS Earth Sciences Proprietary Limited, and documented in the report entitled "South Deep Gold Mine, Seismic hazard Assessment - June 2025 (Draft Report)" [KB:psha_deep_south.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The objectives of the SRC study are explicitly stated in the KB document psha_deep_south.md in the opening letter section. The document clearly lists the two main purposes: conforming with GISTM requirements and providing improved site-specific seismic characterization compared to 2008/2009 design. The authorship by SRC and the report title are also directly verified from the document header and executive summary sections.]

The SRC PSHA work produced Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) values that were considerably higher than previously adopted values [KB:psha_deep_south.md][KB:introduction.md]. For the Doornpoort site, the PGA for a 475-year return period (10% probability of exceedance in 50 years) was estimated at 0.33 g, while the PGA for a 10,000-year return period was calculated as 1.3 g, assuming a shear wave velocity at 30 meters depth ($V_{s30}$) value of 600 m/s [KB:psha_deep_south.md]. These values represented a substantial increase from the previously adopted PGA values of 0.15 g for the 475-year return period and 0.25 g for the 10,000-year return period [KB:psha_deep_south.md]. The discrepancy between the seismic intensity values (PGA, PSA) provided by SRC and the regional reference values raised concerns regarding the potential impact on stability and deformation analyses, which would ultimately influence the type and extent of remediation measures required to manage such large ground motions [KB:psha_deep_south.md][KB:introduction.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All PGA values and comparisons are directly extracted from the KB documents. The psha_deep_south.md document explicitly states the SRC PGA estimates of 0.33 g for 475-year return period and 1.3 g for 10,000-year return period with Vs30 of 600 m/s in both the executive summary and the opening letter. The previously adopted values (0.15 g and 0.25 g) are clearly stated in the letter section. The concerns about discrepancies and their impact on remediation measures are directly quoted from the SLR letter section of the KB document.]

Given the specialized nature of the subject and the significant increase in predicted ground motions, SLR Consulting recommended that a third-party review be undertaken on the SRC PSHA work [KB:psha_deep_south.md]. Additionally, SLR recommended that the third-party reviewer should comment on the influence of mining-related seismicity on the modeling and the resultant PGA values [KB:psha_deep_south.md]. These recommendations were motivated by concerns that the adoption of the higher SRC PGA values would significantly impact stability and deformation analyses and quantitative risk assessments (QRAs), likely increasing the scope of possible remedial works [KB:psha_deep_south.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The SRC recommendations are explicitly stated in the KB document psha_deep_south.md in the section "Given the above and since this is a very specialised subject, SLR recommends that:" which lists two specific recommendations: (1) a third-party review be undertaken on the SRC PSHA work, and (2) the reviewer should comment on the influence of mining-related seismicity. The rationale regarding impact on stability analyses and remedial works is directly quoted from the preceding paragraph in the same document.]

## Objectives

The objectives of this work are to conduct a third-party review of the PSHA model, to analyze the possible causes for discrepancies between the seismic intensity values (PGA, PSA) provided by SRC and the regional reference values, and to comment on the influence of mining-related seismicity on the modeling and the resultant PGA values [KB:introduction.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The objectives are directly stated in the KB document introduction.md in the "Objectives [INCOMPLETE]" section. The document explicitly lists three objectives: (1) conduct a third-party review of the PSHA model, (2) analyze possible causes for discrepancies between SRC values and regional reference values, and (3) comment on the influence of mining-related seismicity. These objectives align precisely with the SLR recommendations stated in psha_deep_south.md, providing internal consistency verification.]
