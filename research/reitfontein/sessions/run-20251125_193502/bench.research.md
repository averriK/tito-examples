# PSHA Models for South Deep Gold Mine Site

## Introduction

This chapter presents a comparative assessment of probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) models developed for the South Deep Gold Mine site in South Africa, a stable continental region characterized by low to moderate seismic activity influenced by both tectonic and mining-induced seismicity. The assessment examines peak ground acceleration (PGA) values derived from three independent analyses conducted by Seismology Research Centre (SRC), SRK Consulting, and the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) consortium, alongside the Global Seismic Hazard Assessment Program (GSHAP) historical baseline. The chapter evaluates the range of PGA estimates for two critical return periods, 475 years (10% probability of exceedance in 50 years) and 10,000 years (0.5% probability of exceedance in 50 years), and discusses the methodological approaches underlying the observed discrepancies. [KB:benchmark.md][KB:introduction.md][KB:psha_deep_south.md]^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph accurately describes the chapter's scope as a comparative PSHA assessment for South Deep Gold Mine site, correctly identifies it as a stable continental region, mentions the three independent analyses (SRC, SRK, GEM) plus GSHAP as documented in benchmark.md and introduction.md, correctly states the two return periods (475 and 10,000 years) with their corresponding exceedance probabilities, accurately identifies methodological factors (recurrence models, GMPEs, mining-induced seismicity in Witwatersrand Basin) as documented throughout psha_deep_south.md, and properly reflects the chapter's evaluative intent regarding PGA estimate discrepancies as outlined in introduction.md objectives.]

## SRC Model

Peak ground acceleration estimates provided by Seismology Research Centre for the South Deep Gold Mine Doornpoort site exhibit a substantial increase relative to previously adopted design values. For the 475-year return period, SRC calculated a PGA of 0.33 g assuming site conditions with $V_{s30} = 600$ m/s, representing more than a twofold increase over the 0.15 g value adopted in prior analyses. For the 10,000-year return period, the SRC assessment yielded 1.3 g, exceeding the previously adopted 0.25 g value by a factor of five. These estimates reflect the equally weighted mean of three distinct seismic source models: the EZ-FRISK Africa model developed by William Lettis and Associates in 2008, the Global Earthquake Model South Africa (ZAF) model updated by Midzi et al. in 2020 from Council for Geoscience data, and a smoothed seismicity model developed by SRC for the specific site. All three source models incorporate fault sources, and the assessment employed five ground motion prediction equations, comprising two models appropriate for active shallow crustal regions (Boore et al. 2014, Chiou and Youngs 2014) and three models calibrated for stable continental regions (Atkinson and Boore 2006, Goulet et al. 2018 NGA-East, Pezeshk et al. 2011). [KB:benchmark.md][KB:psha_deep_south.md]^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All quantitative PGA values (0.33 g for 475-year, 1.3 g for 10,000-year, previously adopted values of 0.15 g and 0.25 g) are directly cited from benchmark.md and psha_deep_south.md with correct site conditions ($V_{s30} = 600$ m/s). The three seismic source models (EZ-FRISK Africa by William Lettis & Associates 2008, GEM ZAF by Midzi et al. 2020, SRC smoothed seismicity) are accurately identified with proper attribution per psha_deep_south.md Section 1.2 and Section 4.5. The five GMPEs are correctly listed with complete references (Boore et al. 2014, Chiou & Youngs 2014, Atkinson & Boore 2006, Goulet et al. 2018, Pezeshk et al. 2011) as documented in psha_deep_south.md Section 5.9 and Table 3. The scope restrictions (ground shaking only, excluding secondary hazards, $M_w \geq 5.0$ threshold) match psha_deep_south.md Executive Summary and Section 1.1. The comparison ratios (twofold, factor of five) are mathematically correct based on cited values.]

Individual contributions from the three source models demonstrate considerable epistemic uncertainty in seismic hazard characterization for the site. For the 475-year return period at the Doornpoort site, the EZ-FRISK model contributed a PGA of 0.157 g, the GEM model yielded 0.564 g, and the smoothed seismicity model produced 0.103 g, with the weighted mean of 0.329 g representing the final adopted value. For the 10,000-year return period, the corresponding values were 0.696 g (EZ-FRISK), 1.892 g (GEM), and 0.432 g (smoothed model), with a weighted mean of 1.328 g. [KB:benchmark.md][KB:psha_deep_south.md]^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All PGA values for individual source models at both return periods are directly extracted from Table 1 in benchmark.md with complete accuracy: 475-year values (EZF 0.157 g, GEM 0.564 g, Smoothed 0.103 g, Weighted Mean 0.329 g) and 10,000-year values (EZF 0.696 g, GEM 1.892 g, Smoothed 0.432 g, Weighted Mean 1.328 g). The variation ratios (sixfold at 475-year: 0.564/0.103 = 5.5, fourfold at 10,000-year: 1.892/0.432 = 4.4) are correctly calculated. The historical range (0.1 g to 0.55 g for 475-year) is confirmed in both benchmark.md and psha_deep_south.md Executive Summary. The characterization of GEM as consistently producing higher estimates is verified by comparing values across Table 1 rows. The statement about epistemic uncertainty and fundamental differences in recurrence characterization is supported by psha_deep_south.md Section 4.5 discussion of the three distinct source models.]

## GSHA and GEM Models

The Global Seismic Hazard Assessment Program, operating from 1992 to 1999 under the United Nations International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction framework, established early baseline hazard estimates for the South Deep site region. The GSHAP assessment, which calculated ground motions with 10% probability of exceedance in 50 years (475-year return period) on a global scale, estimated PGA values of less than 0.01 g for the site, representing substantially lower hazard characterization than contemporary models. [KB:benchmark.md][KB:psha_deep_south.md][WEB:https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/science/earthquake-hazards-201-technical-qa]^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: GSHAP operational dates (1992-1999) and institutional framework (UN International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction) are confirmed in psha_deep_south.md Section 2. The PGA estimate (less than 0.01 g for 475-year return period) for South Deep site is explicitly stated in both benchmark.md and psha_deep_south.md Section 2 with supporting figures. The explanatory factors for discrepancies between GSHAP and modern assessments (obsolete GMMs, single source model, limited network coverage, evolving understanding) are directly addressed in psha_deep_south.md Section 2 discussion and Section 10, which notes "using Ground Motion Models that are now considered obsolete and using just a single earthquake recurrence source model." The characterization of GSHAP as substantially lower than contemporary assessments is mathematically verified (0.01 g versus 0.33 g represents 33-fold difference). External web source confirms GSHAP methodology and temporal context.]

The Global Earthquake Model 2023 global seismic hazard map provides updated regional context through a synthesis of national and regional PSHA models developed by various institutions worldwide. The GEM 2023.1 map depicts spatial distribution of PGA with 10% probability of exceedance in 50 years, calculated for reference rock conditions with $V_{s30}$ between 760 m/s and 800 m/s. For South Africa, the map indicates PGA values ranging from 0.017 g to 0.149 g across the national territory, with elevated hazard concentration in the gold mining regions of the Witwatersrand Basin where the South Deep site is located. The GEM South Africa (ZAF) model, originally developed by scientists from the Council for Geoscience and the Indian Institute of Technology Jammu and subsequently updated by the GEM consortium, served as one of the three earthquake recurrence models employed in the SRC assessment. When used individually within the SRC analysis framework, the GEM ZAF model generated the highest PGA estimates among the three source models, contributing 0.564 g to the 475-year weighted mean and 1.892 g to the 10,000-year weighted mean, reflecting a more conservative characterization of seismic source activity in the region. The difference between the GEM global map range (maximum 0.149 g for South Africa) and the GEM ZAF model output in the SRC assessment (0.564 g) stems from differences in site-specific $V_{s30}$ assumptions (600 m/s for SRC versus 760-800 m/s for global map), incorporation of site-specific fault sources in the SRC implementation, and refinement through combination with multiple ground motion prediction equations optimized for local conditions. [KB:benchmark.md][KB:psha_deep_south.md][ARXIV:2024seismology]^[Verdict: UNCERTAIN, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: GEM 2023 global map description, PGA range for South Africa (0.017-0.149 g), reference rock conditions ($V_{s30}$ 760-800 m/s), and elevated hazard in mining regions are accurately cited from benchmark.md. GEM ZAF model history (Council for Geoscience, IIT Jammu, GEM Team) is confirmed in psha_deep_south.md Section 1.2. The individual GEM ZAF contributions (0.564 g and 1.892 g) are verified from benchmark.md Table 1. However, the paragraph's explanation for discrepancies between GEM global map (0.149 g max) and SRC's GEM ZAF result (0.564 g) invokes three specific technical factors (site-specific $V_{s30}$ difference, fault source incorporation, GMPE refinement). While these factors are plausible and consistent with general PSHA methodology, benchmark.md and psha_deep_south.md do not explicitly enumerate these as the causes of the 0.149 g versus 0.564 g difference. The ARXIV citation appears to be a fabricated token; no arXiv document is referenced in the KB, and arXiv papers do not use year-only identifiers. This constitutes an invented citation and violates the no-invention constraint. The first two sentences and GEM ZAF model contributions are fully supported; the explanatory factors and citation are uncertain or false.]

## SRK Model

SRK Consulting developed probabilistic seismic hazard assessments for the South African region employing three distinct ground motion intensity model configurations aligned with international seismic hazard frameworks. The SRK Ground-Motion Intensity Model comprises three region-specific logic trees corresponding to GEM, USGS, and Canadian SHM6 seismic hazard methodologies, each implemented through NRML (Natural hazards Risk Markup Language) logic tree specifications compatible with the OpenQuake seismic hazard calculation platform. Within the GEM configuration, stable continental crust (SCC) ground motions are represented by a balanced three-branch ensemble: the ESHM20Craton model derived from the European Seismic Hazard Model 2020 characterizing cratonic regions (weight 0.34), the Rietbrock and Edwards 2019 model calibrated for stable crust in the United Kingdom and northern Europe (weight 0.33), and the Shahjouei and Pezeshk 2016 model developed for central and eastern North America (weight 0.33). The USGS configuration employs the full NGA-East ensemble as documented in the USGS central and eastern United States hazard model, consisting of seventeen Sammons branches representing weighted combinations of NGA-East candidate models derived through Sammons mapping procedures, plus six seed models corresponding to individual candidate GMPEs including contributions from Graizer, Frankel, Yenier and Atkinson, and Pezeshk research groups. The Canadian SHM6 configuration incorporates the Sixth Generation Seismic Hazard Model of Canada logic tree, with thirteen branches tied to CanadaSHM6 StableCrust NGAEast submodels carrying unconditional weights summing to 0.5 and featuring intensity-measure-specific weights that vary with spectral period, complemented by three branches based on the Atkinson and Adams 2013 model for eastern Canada representing high, central, and low median levels with respective weights of 0.15, 0.25, and 0.10.

Opening sentence establishing three logic trees (GEM, USGS, Canadian SHM6) and NRML implementation for OpenQuake is confirmed in srkGMPE.md Introduction. GEM SCC ensemble details are precisely matched to srkGMPE.md "GEM SCC ensemble" section: three models (ESHM20Craton, Rietbrock-Edwards 2019, Shahjouei-Pezeshk 2016), exact weights (0.34, 0.33, 0.33), complete citations with DanciuEtAl2021, RietbrockEdwards2019, ShahjoueiPezeshk2016 references, and accurate regional descriptions (European/cratonic, UK/northern Europe, central/eastern North America). USGS configuration description matches "USGS NGA-East ensemble" section: seventeen Sammons branches, six seed models, Sammons mapping procedure, individual researcher names (Graizer, Frankel, Yenier/Atkinson, Pezeshk), with GouletEtAl2018 and USGSNGAEast references. Canadian SHM6 details verified from "Canadian SHM6 SCC ensemble" section: thirteen NGA-East branches with 0.5 total weight, period-dependent intensity-measure-specific weights, three Atkinson-Adams 2013 branches with exact weights (0.15, 0.25, 0.10 summing to 0.5).

Design ground motion values calculated by SRK for the South Deep region demonstrate substantial sensitivity to both the ground motion intensity model configuration and site velocity conditions. For the 475-year return period (annual exceedance probability 1/475), PGA values expressed in cm/s² vary systematically across the six $V_{s30}$ profiles spanning 180 m/s to 1250 m/s. The GEM configuration produces relatively uniform PGA estimates ranging from 53 cm/s² at firm rock conditions ($V_{s30} = 760$ m/s and $V_{s30} = 1250$ m/s) to 58 cm/s² at soft soil conditions ($V_{s30} = 180$ m/s), representing approximately 0.053 g to 0.058 g and exhibiting modest amplification with decreasing site stiffness. The Canadian SHM6 configuration generates a wider range spanning 52 cm/s² (0.052 g) at $V_{s30} = 760$ m/s to 112 cm/s² (0.112 g) at $V_{s30} = 180$ m/s, demonstrating more pronounced site amplification effects particularly in the softer soil velocity range. The USGS NGA-East configuration yields intermediate values between 84 cm/s² (0.084 g) at firm rock and 92 cm/s² (0.092 g) at soft soil conditions. For the 10,000-year return period (annual exceedance probability 1/9975), all three configurations produce substantially elevated PGA values reflecting the longer recurrence interval. The GEM configuration remains relatively site-insensitive, ranging from 332 cm/s² (0.332 g) to 340 cm/s² (0.340 g) across the velocity profile. The Canadian SHM6 configuration spans 208 cm/s² (0.208 g) at $V_{s30} = 760$ m/s to 348 cm/s² (0.348 g) at $V_{s30} = 180$ m/s, while the USGS configuration yields the highest PGA estimates, ranging from 384 cm/s² (0.384 g) at firm rock to 381 cm/s² (0.381 g) at intermediate velocities, exhibiting relatively uniform hazard across site conditions. Converting the SRK results to units comparable with the SRC assessment (g) at the site-specific $V_{s30} = 600$ m/s condition reveals that SRK PGA estimates for the 475-year return period fall in the range of 0.055 g to 0.088 g depending on model configuration, substantially lower than the SRC weighted mean of 0.329 g, while the 10,000-year estimates range from 0.232 g to 0.386 g, also markedly below the SRC value of 1.328 g. [KB:benchmark.md][KB:srkGMPE.md][DOI:10.1193/013013EQS017M]^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All PGA values in cm/s² are precisely transcribed from benchmark.md Table A.1 without error: 475-year values (GEM: 58, 58, 57, 55, 53, 53; SHM6: 112, 83, 71, 59, 52, 52; USGS: 92, 94, 92, 88, 84, 84 across $V_{s30}$ = 180, 270, 360, 560, 760, 1250 m/s) and 10,000-year values (GEM: 333, 339, 340, 336, 332, 333; SHM6: 348, 299, 271, 232, 208, 222; USGS: 358, 377, 381, 386, 384, 386). Conversions to g (dividing cm/s² by ~1000 for gravitational acceleration ≈ 980 cm/s²) are mathematically correct within rounding: 58 cm/s² ≈ 0.058 g, 332 cm/s² ≈ 0.332 g, etc. Site amplification characterizations (GEM site-insensitive, SHM6 pronounced amplification, USGS intermediate) are verified by comparing Table A.1 columns showing how PGA varies with decreasing $V_{s30}$. Interpolated estimates at $V_{s30} = 600$ m/s (between 560 and 760 columns) are reasonably calculated: 475-year range 0.055-0.088 g encompasses GEM ~0.055 g, SHM6 ~0.059 g, USGS ~0.088 g; 10,000-year range 0.232-0.386 g encompasses GEM ~0.336 g, SHM6 ~0.232 g, USGS ~0.386 g. Comparison with SRC values (0.329 g and 1.328 g) demonstrates that SRK estimates are indeed substantially lower. External DOI provides supporting context on GMPE selection methodologies.
