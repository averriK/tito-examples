The assessment examines peak ground acceleration (PGA) values derived from three independent analyses conducted by Seismology Research Centre (SRC), SRK Consulting, and the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) consortium, alongside the Global Seismic Hazard Assessment Program (GSHAP) historical baseline. The chapter evaluates the range of PGA estimates for two critical return periods, 475 years (10% probability of exceedance in 50 years) and 10,000 years (0.5% probability of exceedance in 50 years), and discusses the methodological approaches underlying the observed discrepancies, with particular attention to earthquake recurrence models, ground motion prediction equations calibrated for stable continental regions, and the influence of site-specific factors including mining-related seismicity in the Witwatersrand Basin.

      "paragraph_text": "Peak ground acceleration estimates provided by Seismology Research Centre for the South Deep Gold Mine Doornpoort site exhibit a substantial increase relative to previously adopted design values. For the 475-year return period, SRC calculated a PGA of 0.33 g assuming site conditions with $V_{s30} = 600$ m/s, representing more than a twofold increase over the 0.15 g value adopted in prior analyses. For the 10,000-year return period, the SRC assessment yielded 1.3 g, exceeding the previously adopted 0.25 g value by a factor of five. These estimates reflect the equally weighted mean of three distinct seismic source models: the EZ-FRISK Africa model developed by William Lettis and Associates in 2008, the Global Earthquake Model South Africa (ZAF) model updated by Midzi et al. in 2020 from Council for Geoscience data, and a smoothed seismicity model developed by SRC for the specific site. All three source models incorporate fault sources, and the assessment employed five ground motion prediction equations, comprising two models appropriate for active shallow crustal regions (Boore et al. 2014, Chiou and Youngs 2014) and three models calibrated for stable continental regions (Atkinson and Boore 2006, Goulet et al. 2018 NGA-East, Pezeshk et al. 2011). The SRC study focused exclusively on ground shaking hazard, excluding secondary seismic hazards such as surface rupture, liquefaction, landslides, seiche, tsunami, and subsidence, with a minimum considered magnitude threshold of $M_w \\geq 5.0$.

For the 475-year return period at the Doornpoort site, the EZ-FRISK model contributed a PGA of 0.157 g, the GEM model yielded 0.564 g, and the smoothed seismicity model produced 0.103 g, with the weighted mean of 0.329 g representing the final adopted value.

The nearly sixfold variation between the GEM and smoothed seismicity models at the 475-year level, and the fourfold variation at the 10,000-year level, reflects fundamental differences in earthquake recurrence characterization, with the GEM model producing consistently higher hazard estimates across all return periods. Previous assessments using different methodologies and input data had produced PGA estimates ranging from 0.1 g to 0.55 g for the 475-year return period, indicating that the SRC weighted mean falls within the upper range of historical estimates but is not unprecedented for the site.

For the 475-year return period (annual exceedance probability 1/475), PGA values expressed in cm/s² vary systematically across the six $V_{s30}$ profiles spanning 180 m/s to 1250 m/s. The GEM configuration produces relatively uniform PGA estimates ranging from 53 cm/s² at firm rock conditions ($V_{s30} = 760$ m/s and $V_{s30} = 1250$ m/s) to 58 cm/s² at soft soil conditions ($V_{s30} = 180$ m/s), representing approximately 0.053 g to 0.058 g and exhibiting modest amplification with decreasing site stiffness. The Canadian SHM6 configuration generates a wider range spanning 52 cm/s² (0.052 g) at $V_{s30} = 760$ m/s to 112 cm/s² (0.112 g) at $V_{s30} = 180$ m/s, demonstrating more pronounced site amplification effects particularly in the softer soil velocity range. The USGS NGA-East configuration yields intermediate values between 84 cm/s² (0.084 g) at firm rock and 92 cm/s² (0.092 g) at soft soil conditions. For the 10,000-year return period (annual exceedance probability 1/9975), all three configurations produce substantially elevated PGA values reflecting the longer recurrence interval. The GEM configuration remains relatively site-insensitive, ranging from 332 cm/s² (0.332 g) to 340 cm/s² (0.340 g) across the velocity profile. The Canadian SHM6 configuration spans 208 cm/s² (0.208 g) at $V_{s30} = 760$ m/s to 348 cm/s² (0.348 g) at $V_{s30} = 180$ m/s, while the USGS configuration yields the highest PGA estimates, ranging from 384 cm/s² (0.384 g) at firm rock to 381 cm/s² (0.381 g) at intermediate velocities, exhibiting relatively uniform hazard across site conditions. Converting the SRK results to units comparable with the SRC assessment (g) at the site-specific $V_{s30} = 600$ m/s condition reveals that SRK PGA estimates for the 475-year return period fall in the range of 0.055 g to 0.088 g depending on model configuration, substantially lower than the SRC weighted mean of 0.329 g, while the 10,000-year estimates range from 0.232 g to 0.386 g, also markedly below the SRC value of 1.328 g.

      "paragraph_text": "Peak ground acceleration estimates for critical infrastructure require careful benchmarking against established seismic hazard models to ensure that design values reflect current best practice in probabilistic seismic hazard assessment. The South Deep Gold Mine site presents particular challenges in hazard characterization due to its location within a stable continental region exhibiting both natural tectonic seismicity and mining-induced events. The site occupies a position at the northern margin of the Witwatersrand Basin, a tectonically stable environment where seismic hazard assessment must account for long recurrence intervals between large earthquakes, sparse instrumental records, and uncertainties in distinguishing natural from anthropogenic seismicity [KB:benchmark.md][KB:psha_deep_south.md]. Three principal methodologies provide the basis for benchmarking site-specific hazard estimates: the Seismology Research Centre assessment employing regionally-calibrated source models, the Global Earthquake Model framework incorporating updated national seismic characterizations, and ground-motion intensity models specifically developed for stable continental crust. Comparison of these approaches reveals the epistemic uncertainty inherent in hazard estimation for stable regions and establishes the range of credible PGA values for design return periods of 475 and 10,000 years [KB:benchmark.md][WEB:https://www.iaea.org/publications/15729/evaluation-of-probabilistic-seismic-hazard-analysis-psha-for-nuclear-installations-based-on-observational-data].",

These estimates represent a substantial increase relative to previously adopted design values of 0.15 g and 0.25 g for the respective return periods, reflecting advancements in seismic source characterization and ground-motion modeling since earlier assessments [KB:psha_deep_south.md]. The SRC methodology employed an equally weighted ensemble of three seismic source models: the EZ-FRISK Africa model developed by William Lettis and Associates, the GEM South Africa model updated by Midzi and colleagues at the Council for Geoscience, and a smoothed seismicity model developed specifically for the site by SRC staff [KB:benchmark.md][KB:psha_deep_south.md]. Each source model incorporated both areal source zones and discrete fault sources, with the Pretorius Fault and Reitfontein Fault included as active structures exhibiting present-day seismic activity potentially related to mining-induced stress changes [KB:psha_deep_south.md]. Ground-motion prediction employed a weighted logic tree combining five models: Boore and colleagues 2014 and Chiou and Youngs 2014 for active shallow crustal regions, supplemented by Atkinson and Boore 2006, Goulet and colleagues 2018 NGA-East ensemble, and Pezeshk and colleagues 2011 for stable continental regions [KB:benchmark.md][KB:psha_deep_south.md]. The weighted mean hazard across all source and ground-motion model branches yields the final PGA estimates, with disaggregation analysis indicating that magnitude 5 to 7 earthquakes at distances of 10 to 50 km dominate the hazard at both return periods [KB:psha_deep_south.md]. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the GEM source model contributes the highest hazard among the three source models, producing PGA values of 0.564 g and 1.892 g for 475-year and 10,000-year return periods respectively, while the smoothed seismicity model yields the most conservative estimates at 0.103 g and 0.432 g [KB:benchmark.md]. The substantial range between individual model results, spanning more than a factor of five at the 475-year return period, quantifies the epistemic uncertainty in seismic source characterization for this stable continental setting and motivates the ensemble approach adopted in the final hazard estimates [KB:benchmark.md][KB:psha_deep_south.md].",

The Global Seismic Hazard Assessment Program, conducted from 1992 to 1999 under United Nations auspices, estimated PGA values below 0.01 g for the 475-year return period at the South Deep site, representing the state of knowledge and modeling capability of that era [KB:benchmark.md][KB:psha_deep_south.md]. The Global Earthquake Model 2023 global seismic hazard map, version 2023.1, incorporates updated seismic source characterizations and modern ground-motion models, calculating PGA with 10 percent probability of exceedance in 50 years for reference rock conditions with $V_{s30}$ between 760 and 800 m/s [KB:benchmark.md][WEB:https://www.globalquakemodel.org/product/global-seismic-hazard-map]. For South Africa, the GEM global map indicates PGA values ranging from 0.017 g to 0.149 g for the 475-year return period, with elevated hazard observed in the Witwatersrand gold mining region where the South Deep site is located [KB:benchmark.md][WEB:https://www.globalquakemodel.org/product/global-seismic-hazard-map]. The GEM South Africa national model, developed by Midzi and colleagues at the Council for Geoscience and updated by the GEM team, forms one of the three source models employed in the SRC site-specific assessment [KB:benchmark.md][KB:psha_deep_south.md]. This national model utilizes a newly compiled earthquake catalogue extending from 1620 to 2019, incorporating data from the South African National Seismograph Network and supplemented by records from the International Seismological Centre [KB:psha_deep_south.md]. Events larger than magnitude 4 within the mining region were retained in the catalogue, as such events have caused damage both underground and at the surface, while smaller events identified with mine placenames were excluded to minimize contamination from mining-induced seismicity unrepresentative of tectonic hazard [KB:psha_deep_south.md]. The substantial increase in PGA estimates from GSHAP values below 0.01 g to GEM 2023 values approaching 0.15 g in the mining region reflects multiple factors: improved seismograph coverage enabling detection of smaller events and more accurate magnitude determination, incorporation of recent seismicity including mining-related events that may indicate tectonic stress states, updated ground-motion models developed specifically for stable continental regions, and refined seismic source characterizations incorporating neotectonic fault mapping [KB:psha_deep_south.md][WEB:https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019rg000653]. The difference between the GEM global map reference site condition of $V_{s30} = 760$ to 800 m/s and the SRC site-specific value of $V_{s30} = 600$ m/s introduces additional variability in direct comparison, as the softer site conditions at the actual facility amplify ground motions relative to the reference rock conditions, particularly at shorter structural periods [KB:psha_deep_south.md][WEB:https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019rg000653].",

Logic-tree weights of 0.34 for ESHM20Craton and 0.33 each for Rietbrock-Edwards and Shahjouei-Pezeshk ensure that all three branches contribute approximately equally to the final hazard estimates [KB:srkGMPE.md]. The USGS stable continental crust representation employs the full NGA-East ensemble as documented in the USGS central and eastern United States hazard model, comprising seventeen Sammons branches representing weighted combinations of NGA-East candidate models derived through Sammons mapping and averaging, supplemented by six seed models corresponding to individual NGA-East candidate GMPEs including models by Graizer, Frankel, Yenier and Atkinson, and Pezeshk [KB:srkGMPE.md][WEB:https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019rg000653]. The Canadian SHM6 stable continental crust ensemble combines thirteen branches tied to different NGA-East realizations with unconditional weights summing to 0.5, supplemented by three branches based on the Atkinson and Adams 2013 model for eastern Canada representing high, central, and low median levels with weights of 0.15, 0.25, and 0.10 respectively [KB:srkGMPE.md]. Application of these three logic-tree configurations to the South Deep site yields PGA estimates that vary systematically with both site condition and model selection. For the 475-year return period and mean PGA, the GEM configuration produces values ranging from 53 to 58 cm per second squared across the $V_{s30}$ range of 180 to 1250 m per second, the SHM6 configuration yields 52 to 112 cm per second squared, and the USGS configuration gives 84 to 94 cm per second squared [KB:benchmark.md]. For the 10,000-year return period, the GEM configuration produces mean PGA values of 332 to 340 cm per second squared, SHM6 yields 208 to 348 cm per second squared, and USGS gives 358 to 386 cm per second squared [KB:benchmark.md]. Converting these values to acceleration expressed in units of gravitational acceleration yields approximate ranges of 0.05 to 0.11 g for the 475-year return period and 0.21 to 0.39 g for the 10,000-year return period, substantially lower than the SRC estimates of 0.33 g and 1.3 g for the respective return periods [KB:benchmark.md]. The systematic differences between SRK and SRC estimates reflect multiple sources of epistemic uncertainty: the selection of source models with different activity rates and maximum magnitudes, the choice of ground-motion models calibrated on different regional datasets, the treatment of site amplification effects at the $V_{s30} = 600$ m per second condition, and the inclusion or exclusion of local fault sources that may dominate hazard at short distances [KB:benchmark.md][KB:srkGMPE.md][KB:psha_deep_south.md]. The SRK ensemble emphasizes stable continental crust GMPEs developed from global datasets including European, North American, and Canadian regions, while the SRC assessment incorporates both stable continental and active crustal models to capture potential higher ground motions if local structures exhibit characteristics intermediate between stable and active regimes [KB:srkGMPE.md][KB:psha_deep_south.md][WEB:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12572-022-00325-0].",

The conversion to g-units (0.05-0.11 g for 475-year, 0.21-0.39 g for 10,000-year) is mathematically correct (dividing cm/s^2 by 981 cm/s^2).

      "paragraph_text": "Seismic hazard assessment for the South Deep Gold Mine site in South Africa requires evaluating ground motion intensity values derived from probabilistic seismic hazard analysis. The primary focus concerns estimating peak ground acceleration values for specified return periods, particularly 475 years and 10,000 years, to support dam safety assessment and tailings storage facility design conforming to Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management requirements. Historical estimates of peak ground acceleration for the site have varied substantially across different methodologies, ranging from 0.1 g to 0.55 g for the 475-year return period. The Seismology Research Centre produced site-specific calculations yielding 0.33 g for the 475-year return period and 1.3 g for the 10,000-year return period, assuming $V_{s30} = 600$ m/s, values considerably higher than previously adopted design criteria of 0.15 g and 0.25 g respectively. These discrepancies motivated the present review comparing the SRC assessment with other established models including the Global Earthquake Model South Africa model, regional assessments by SRK Consulting employing multiple ground-motion prediction equation ensembles calibrated for stable continental regions, and global reference values from the Global Seismic Hazard Assessment Program.

      "paragraph_text": "The Seismology Research Centre probabilistic seismic hazard assessment for the South Deep Gold Mine employed three seismic source models with equal weighting: the EZ-FRISK Africa model developed by William Lettis and Associates in 2008, the Global Earthquake Model South Africa model updated by Midzi et al. in 2020 from Council for Geoscience data, and a smoothed seismicity model developed by SRC staff member Russell Cuthbertson specifically for this site. All three models incorporated fault sources, with the Pretorius Fault Zone and Reitfontein Fault identified as active structures based on present-day seismic activity despite their Archaean to Paleoproterozoic age. The ground motion model logic tree combined five prediction equations: two for active shallow crustal regions (Boore et al. 2014, Chiou and Youngs 2014) and three for stable continental regions (Atkinson and Boore 2006, Goulet et al. 2018 NGA-East, Pezeshk et al. 2011). For the Doornpoort New Facility site at coordinates 27.4602 degrees S, 27.6501 degrees E, the equally weighted mean of the three source models produced peak ground acceleration estimates of 0.329 g for the 475-year return period and 1.328 g for the 10,000-year return period, assuming site conditions with $V_{s30} = 600$ m/s and minimum magnitude $M_w \\geq 5.0$. Individual source model contributions varied markedly: the GEM model yielded 0.564 g at 475 years, the EZ-FRISK model 0.157 g, and the smoothed seismicity model 0.103 g. This substantial inter-model variation reflects epistemic uncertainty in characterizing earthquake recurrence in a stable continental region where the duration of instrumental and historical records remains short relative to characteristic return periods of large earthquakes. The assessment methodology applied the ergodic principle, trading spatial extent for temporal duration to estimate large-magnitude recurrence rates from observed small-magnitude seismicity distributions.

      "paragraph_text": "The Global Seismic Hazard Assessment Program, operating from 1992 to 1999 under the United Nations International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction framework, produced worldwide hazard estimates for 10 percent probability of exceedance in 50 years. For the South Deep Gold Mine site, the GSHAP assessment indicated peak ground acceleration below 0.01 g for the 475-year return period, representing conditions substantially less hazardous than recent analyses suggest. The Global Earthquake Model 2023 global seismic hazard map version 2023.1 depicts the spatial distribution of peak ground acceleration with 10 percent probability of exceedance in 50 years, calculated for reference rock conditions with $V_{s30}$ between 760 m/s and 800 m/s using the OpenQuake engine. The map was compiled from 31 national and regional probabilistic seismic hazard models developed by various institutions in collaboration with GEM Foundation scientists, with border harmonization achieved through smoothing methodologies and interpolation of values calculated at approximately 6 km spacing. For South Africa, the GEM 2023.1 map displays peak ground acceleration ranging from 0.017 g to 0.149 g across the country, with elevated hazard concentrated in gold mining regions where induced seismicity contributes to the total seismic hazard. The GEM South Africa model incorporated in the SRC assessment represents one of the three earthquake recurrence models employed, contributing significantly to the higher weighted mean hazard estimate. Differences between GSHAP, GEM global map values, and site-specific SRC calculations reflect advances in ground motion prediction equations, increased spatial resolution of hazard calculations, use of multiple earthquake recurrence models to capture epistemic uncertainty, refined understanding of mining-induced seismicity contributions, and adoption of site-specific soil conditions rather than reference rock conditions.

      "paragraph_text": "SRK Consulting prepared probabilistic seismic hazard assessment studies for the South Deep region employing ground-motion prediction equation ensembles specifically calibrated for stable continental crust conditions. The SRK intensity model implements three region-specific logic trees corresponding to GEM, USGS, and Canadian SHM6 seismic hazard configurations, each representing different approaches to characterizing ground motions in stable continental regions. Within the GEM configuration, stable continental crust is represented by a three-branch ensemble comprising the ESHM20Craton model derived from the European Seismic Hazard Model 2020 characterizing cratonic ground motions in European regions, the Rietbrock and Edwards 2019 model calibrated for stable crust in the United Kingdom and northern Europe, and the Shahjouei and Pezeshk 2016 model developed for central and eastern North America representing broader stable continental behavior. The logic tree assigns weights of 0.34 to ESHM20Craton and 0.33 to each of Rietbrock-Edwards and Shahjouei-Pezeshk, forming a balanced modern representation of stable continental crust motions. Within the USGS configuration, stable continental crust motions employ the complete NGA-East USGS ensemble documented in the central and eastern United States hazard model, consisting of seventeen Sammons branches each representing a weighted combination of NGA-East candidate models derived through Sammons mapping and averaging procedures, plus six seed models corresponding to individual NGA-East candidate ground-motion prediction equations including models by Graizer, Frankel, Yenier and Atkinson, and Pezeshk. Within the Canadian SHM6 configuration, thirteen branches correspond to submodels of CanadaSHM6 StableCrust NGAEast tied to different NGA-East realizations carrying unconditional weights summing to 0.5, with intensity-measure-specific weights allowing relative contributions to vary with spectral period reflecting period-dependent epistemic uncertainty, while the remaining 0.5 weight is allocated to three branches based on the Atkinson and Adams 2013 stable-crust model for eastern Canada representing high, central, and low median levels with unconditional weights of 0.15, 0.25, and 0.10 respectively. Design ground motions calculated using these ensembles for annual exceedance probability of 1/475 years and 1/9975 years, assuming site conditions with $V_{s30}$ ranging from 180 m/s to 1250 m/s, produced peak ground acceleration values in units of cm/s² as follows: for the 475-year return period the GEM configuration yielded 53 to 58 cm/s², the SHM6 configuration 52 to 112 cm/s², and the USGS configuration 84 to 92 cm/s², while for the 9975-year return period the GEM configuration yielded 332 to 340 cm/s², the SHM6 configuration 208 to 348 cm/s², and the USGS configuration 358 to 386 cm/s². Converting to standard engineering units, these ranges correspond to approximately 0.05 to 0.11 g for the 475-year return period and 0.21 to 0.39 g for the 10,000-year return period across the three configurations and site condition range. The SRK approach emphasizes capturing epistemic uncertainty through multiple independent ground-motion prediction equation ensembles rather than relying on a single regional calibration, reflecting recognition that stable continental regions lack the extensive strong-motion datasets available for active tectonic regions, requiring integration of models developed from diverse stable regions worldwide to adequately span the range of plausible ground motion characterizations.
