# PSHA Models for South Deep Gold Mine Site

## Introduction

This chapter presents a comparative assessment of probabilistic seismic hazard analysis models developed for the South Deep Gold Mine site in South Africa, a stable continental region characterized by low to moderate seismic activity influenced by both tectonic and mining-induced seismicity. The assessment examines peak ground acceleration values derived from three independent analyses conducted by Seismology Research Centre, SRK Consulting, and the Global Earthquake Model consortium, alongside the Global Seismic Hazard Assessment Program historical baseline. The chapter evaluates the range of PGA estimates for two critical return periods—475 years (10 percent probability of exceedance in 50 years) and 10,000 years (0.5 percent probability of exceedance in 50 years)—and discusses the methodological approaches underlying the observed discrepancies, with particular attention to earthquake recurrence models, ground motion prediction equations calibrated for stable continental regions, and the influence of site-specific factors including mining-related seismicity in the Witwatersrand Basin [@Benchmark2025][@Introduction2025][@PSHADeepSouth2025][@IAEA2024].

## SRC Model

Peak ground acceleration estimates provided by Seismology Research Centre for the South Deep Gold Mine Doornpoort site exhibit a substantial increase relative to previously adopted design values. For the 475-year return period, SRC calculated a PGA of 0.33 g assuming site conditions with $V_{s30} = 600$ m/s, representing more than a twofold increase over the 0.15 g value adopted in prior analyses. For the 10,000-year return period, the SRC assessment yielded 1.3 g, exceeding the previously adopted 0.25 g value by a factor of five [@Benchmark2025][@PSHADeepSouth2025].

The SRC methodology employed an equally weighted ensemble of three seismic source models: the EZ-FRISK Africa model developed by William Lettis and Associates in 2008, the Global Earthquake Model South Africa model updated by Midzi and colleagues in 2020 from Council for Geoscience data, and a smoothed seismicity model developed by SRC staff specifically for the site. All three source models incorporate fault sources, including the Pretorius Fault Zone and Reitfontein Fault identified as active structures based on present-day seismic activity. The assessment employed five ground motion prediction equations, comprising two models appropriate for active shallow crustal regions (Boore et al. 2014, Chiou and Youngs 2014) and three models calibrated for stable continental regions (Atkinson and Boore 2006, Goulet et al. 2018 NGA-East, Pezeshk et al. 2011). The SRC study focused exclusively on ground shaking hazard, excluding secondary seismic hazards such as surface rupture, liquefaction, landslides, seiche, tsunami, and subsidence, with a minimum considered magnitude threshold of $M_w \geq 5.0$ [@Benchmark2025][@PSHADeepSouth2025].

Individual contributions from the three source models demonstrate considerable epistemic uncertainty in seismic hazard characterization for the site. For the 475-year return period at the Doornpoort site, the EZ-FRISK model contributed a PGA of 0.157 g, the GEM model yielded 0.564 g, and the smoothed seismicity model produced 0.103 g, with the weighted mean of 0.329 g representing the final adopted value. For the 10,000-year return period, the corresponding values were 0.696 g (EZ-FRISK), 1.892 g (GEM), and 0.432 g (smoothed model), with a weighted mean of 1.328 g. The nearly sixfold variation between the GEM and smoothed seismicity models at the 475-year level, and the fourfold variation at the 10,000-year level, reflects fundamental differences in earthquake recurrence characterization, with the GEM model producing consistently higher hazard estimates across all return periods. Previous assessments using different methodologies and input data had produced PGA estimates ranging from 0.1 g to 0.55 g for the 475-year return period, indicating that the SRC weighted mean falls within the upper range of historical estimates but is not unprecedented for the site [@Benchmark2025][@PSHADeepSouth2025].

## Global Models

The Global Seismic Hazard Assessment Program, operating from 1992 to 1999 under the United Nations International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction framework, established early baseline hazard estimates for the South Deep site region. The GSHAP assessment, which calculated ground motions with 10 percent probability of exceedance in 50 years (475-year return period) on a global scale, estimated PGA values of less than 0.01 g for the site, representing substantially lower hazard characterization than contemporary models. This discrepancy between GSHAP and modern assessments arises from multiple methodological advances over the intervening decades, including the adoption of ground motion models now considered obsolete in GSHAP, reliance on a single earthquake recurrence source model rather than capturing epistemic uncertainty through multiple models, limited seismograph network coverage in the 1990s relative to current instrumentation, and evolving understanding of stable continental region seismicity and the contribution of mining-induced events[@PSHADeepSouth2025][@USGSHazards2024].

The Global Earthquake Model (GEM), version 2023.1, incorporates updated seismic source characterizations and modern ground motion models, calculating PGA with 10 percent probability of exceedance in 50 years for reference rock conditions with $V_{s30}$ between 760 and 800 m/s using the OpenQuake engine. The map was compiled from 31 national and regional probabilistic seismic hazard models developed by various institutions in collaboration with GEM Foundation scientists, with border harmonization achieved through smoothing methodologies and interpolation of values calculated at approximately 6 km spacing. For South Africa, the GEM 2023 map displays peak ground acceleration ranging from 0.017 g to 0.149 g across the country, with elevated hazard concentrated in gold mining regions where induced seismicity contributes to the total seismic hazard [@GEMHazardMap2023][@OpenQuake2023].

The GEM South Africa national model, developed by Midzi and colleagues at the Council for Geoscience and updated by the GEM team, forms one of the three source models employed in the SRC site-specific assessment. This national model utilizes a newly compiled earthquake catalogue extending from 1620 to 2019, incorporating data from the South African National Seismograph Network and supplemented by records from the International Seismological Centre. Events larger than magnitude 4 within the mining region were retained in the catalogue, as such events have caused damage both underground and at the surface, while smaller events identified with mine placenames were excluded to minimize contamination from mining-induced seismicity unrepresentative of tectonic hazard.

The substantial increase in PGA estimates from GSHAP values below 0.01 g to GEM 2023 values approaching 0.15 g in the mining region reflects improved seismograph coverage enabling detection of smaller events and more accurate magnitude determination, incorporation of recent seismicity including mining-related events that may indicate tectonic stress states, updated ground motion models developed specifically for stable continental regions, and refined seismic source characterizations incorporating neotectonic fault mapping. The difference between the GEM global map reference site condition of $V_{s30} = 760$ to 800 m/s and the SRC site-specific value of $V_{s30} = 600$ m/s introduces additional variability in direct comparison, as the softer site conditions at the actual facility amplify ground motions relative to the reference rock conditions, particularly at shorter structural periods [@AGU2019].

## SRK Model

SRK Consulting developed probabilistic seismic hazard assessments for the South African region employing three distinct ground motion intensity model configurations aligned with international seismic hazard frameworks. The SRK Ground-Motion Intensity Model comprises three region-specific logic trees corresponding to GEM, USGS, and Canadian SHM6 seismic hazard methodologies, each implemented through NRML (Natural hazards Risk Markup Language) logic tree specifications compatible with the OpenQuake seismic hazard calculation platform [@SRKGMPE2025][@Rietbrock2019].

Within the GEM configuration, stable continental crust ground motions are represented by a balanced three-branch ensemble: the ESHM20Craton model derived from the European Seismic Hazard Model 2020 characterizing cratonic regions (weight 0.34), the Rietbrock and Edwards 2019 model calibrated for stable crust in the United Kingdom and northern Europe (weight 0.33), and the Shahjouei and Pezeshk 2016 model developed for central and eastern North America (weight 0.33). The USGS configuration employs the full NGA-East ensemble as documented in the USGS central and eastern United States hazard model, consisting of seventeen Sammons branches representing weighted combinations of NGA-East candidate models derived through Sammons mapping procedures, plus six seed models corresponding to individual candidate GMPEs including contributions from Graizer, Frankel, Yenier and Atkinson, and Pezeshk research groups. The Canadian SHM6 configuration incorporates the Sixth Generation Seismic Hazard Model of Canada logic tree, with thirteen branches tied to CanadaSHM6 StableCrust NGAEast submodels carrying unconditional weights summing to 0.5 and featuring intensity-measure-specific weights that vary with spectral period, complemented by three branches based on the Atkinson and Adams 2013 model for eastern Canada representing high, central, and low median levels with respective weights of 0.15, 0.25, and 0.10 [@SRKGMPE2025][@Rietbrock2019][@Springer2020].

Design ground motion values calculated by SRK for the South Deep region demonstrate substantial sensitivity to both the ground motion intensity model configuration and site velocity conditions. For the 475-year return period (annual exceedance probability 1/475), PGA values expressed in cm per second squared vary systematically across the six $V_{s30}$ profiles spanning 180 m/s to 1250 m/s. The GEM configuration produces relatively uniform PGA estimates ranging from 53 cm/s² at firm rock conditions ($V_{s30} = 760$ m/s and $V_{s30} = 1250$ m/s) to 58 cm/s² at soft soil conditions ($V_{s30} = 180$ m/s), representing approximately 0.053 g to 0.058 g and exhibiting modest amplification with decreasing site stiffness. The Canadian SHM6 configuration generates a wider range spanning 52 cm/s² (0.052 g) at $V_{s30} = 760$ m/s to 112 cm/s² (0.112 g) at $V_{s30} = 180$ m/s, demonstrating more pronounced site amplification effects particularly in the softer soil velocity range. The USGS NGA-East configuration yields intermediate values between 84 cm/s² (0.084 g) at firm rock and 92 cm/s² (0.092 g) at soft soil conditions [@Benchmark2025][@SRKGMPE2025][@Atkinson2013].

For the 10,000-year return period (annual exceedance probability 1/9975), all three configurations produce substantially elevated PGA values reflecting the longer recurrence interval. The GEM configuration remains relatively site-insensitive, ranging from 332 cm/s² to 340 cm/s²  across the velocity profile. The Canadian SHM6 configuration spans 208 cm/s² at $V_{s30} = 760$ m/s to 348 cm/s²  at $V_{s30} = 180$ m/s, while the USGS configuration yields the highest PGA estimates, ranging from 384 cm/s²  at firm rock to 381 cm/s² at intermediate velocities, exhibiting relatively uniform hazard across site conditions [@Benchmark2025][@SRKGMPE2025][@Atkinson2013].

SRK PGA estimates at the site-specific $V_{s30} = 600$ m/s condition for the 475-year return period fall in the range of 0.055 g to 0.088 g depending on model configuration, substantially lower than the SRC weighted mean of 0.329 g, while the 10,000-year estimates range from 0.232 g to 0.386 g, also markedly below the SRC value of 1.328 g. The systematic differences between SRK and SRC estimates reflect multiple sources of epistemic uncertainty: the selection of source models with different activity rates and maximum magnitudes, the choice of ground motion models calibrated on different regional datasets, the treatment of site amplification effects, and the inclusion or exclusion of local fault sources that may dominate hazard at short distances. The SRK ensemble emphasizes stable continental crust GMPEs developed from global datasets including European, North American, and Canadian regions, while the SRC assessment incorporates both stable continental and active crustal models to capture potential higher ground motions if local structures exhibit characteristics intermediate between stable and active regimes [@Benchmark2025][@SRKGMPE2025][@PSHADeepSouth2025][@Springer2022].
