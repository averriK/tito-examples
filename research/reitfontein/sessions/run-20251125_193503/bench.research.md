# PSHA Models for South Deep Gold Mine Site

## Introduction

Peak ground acceleration estimates for critical infrastructure require careful benchmarking against established seismic hazard models to ensure that design values reflect current best practice in probabilistic seismic hazard assessment. The South Deep Gold Mine site presents particular challenges in hazard characterization due to its location within a stable continental region exhibiting both natural tectonic seismicity and mining-induced events. The site occupies a position at the northern margin of the Witwatersrand Basin, a tectonically stable environment where seismic hazard assessment must account for long recurrence intervals between large earthquakes, sparse instrumental records, and uncertainties in distinguishing natural from anthropogenic seismicity [KB:benchmark.md][KB:psha_deep_south.md]. Three principal methodologies provide the basis for benchmarking site-specific hazard estimates: the Seismology Research Centre assessment employing regionally-calibrated source models, the Global Earthquake Model framework incorporating updated national seismic characterizations, and ground-motion intensity models specifically developed for stable continental crust. Comparison of these approaches reveals the epistemic uncertainty inherent in hazard estimation for stable regions and establishes the range of credible PGA values for design return periods of 475 and 10,000 years [KB:benchmark.md][WEB:https://www.iaea.org/publications/15729/evaluation-of-probabilistic-seismic-hazard-analysis-psha-for-nuclear-installations-based-on-observational-data].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph presents an accurate introduction to PSHA benchmarking for the South Deep site.

## SRC Model

The Seismology Research Centre probabilistic seismic hazard assessment for the South Deep Gold Mine site calculated PGA values of 0.33 g for the 475-year return period and 1.3 g for the 10,000-year return period, assuming site conditions characterized by $V_{s30} = 600$ m/s at the Doornpoort facility [KB:benchmark.md][KB:psha_deep_south.md]. These estimates represent a substantial increase relative to previously adopted design values of 0.15 g and 0.25 g for the respective return periods, reflecting advancements in seismic source characterization and ground-motion modeling since earlier assessments [KB:psha_deep_south.md]. The SRC methodology employed an equally weighted ensemble of three seismic source models: the EZ-FRISK Africa model developed by William Lettis and Associates, the GEM South Africa model updated by Midzi and colleagues at the Council for Geoscience, and a smoothed seismicity model developed specifically for the site by SRC staff [KB:benchmark.md][KB:psha_deep_south.md]. Each source model incorporated both areal source zones and discrete fault sources, with the Pretorius Fault and Reitfontein Fault included as active structures exhibiting present-day seismic activity potentially related to mining-induced stress changes [KB:psha_deep_south.md]. Ground-motion prediction employed a weighted logic tree combining five models: Boore and colleagues 2014 and Chiou and Youngs 2014 for active shallow crustal regions, supplemented by Atkinson and Boore 2006, Goulet and colleagues 2018 NGA-East ensemble, and Pezeshk and colleagues 2011 for stable continental regions [KB:benchmark.md][KB:psha_deep_south.md]. The weighted mean hazard across all source and ground-motion model branches yields the final PGA estimates, with disaggregation analysis indicating that magnitude 5 to 7 earthquakes at distances of 10 to 50 km dominate the hazard at both return periods [KB:psha_deep_south.md]. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the GEM source model contributes the highest hazard among the three source models, producing PGA values of 0.564 g and 1.892 g for 475-year and 10,000-year return periods respectively, while the smoothed seismicity model yields the most conservative estimates at 0.103 g and 0.432 g [KB:benchmark.md]. The substantial range between individual model results, spanning more than a factor of five at the 475-year return period, quantifies the epistemic uncertainty in seismic source characterization for this stable continental setting and motivates the ensemble approach adopted in the final hazard estimates [KB:benchmark.md][KB:psha_deep_south.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately synthesizes SRC model results from the KB sources. The PGA values of 0.33 g (475-year) and 1.3 g (10,000-year) are explicitly stated in benchmark.md and psha_deep_south.md. The Vs30 = 600 m/s site condition is confirmed in both sources. Previously adopted values of 0.15 g and 0.25 g are documented in psha_deep_south.md. The three source models (EZ-FRISK, GEM, smoothed) and their equal weighting are explicitly described in both KB files. The five GMPEs listed match exactly those documented in psha_deep_south.md Section 5. The Pretorius and Reitfontein faults are identified as active structures in psha_deep_south.md Section 4.2.2. The disaggregation magnitude and distance ranges are consistent with psha_deep_south.md Section 9.5. The GEM model PGA values of 0.564 g and 1.892 g, and smoothed model values of 0.103 g and 0.432 g, are taken directly from benchmark.md Table 1. All quantitative claims are verifiable from the cited KB sources with no contradictions detected.]

## GSHA and GEM Models

Global and regional seismic hazard frameworks provide essential benchmarking context for site-specific assessments, establishing reference values derived from consistent methodologies applied at continental and national scales. The Global Seismic Hazard Assessment Program, conducted from 1992 to 1999 under United Nations auspices, estimated PGA values below 0.01 g for the 475-year return period at the South Deep site, representing the state of knowledge and modeling capability of that era [KB:benchmark.md][KB:psha_deep_south.md]. The Global Earthquake Model 2023 global seismic hazard map, version 2023.1, incorporates updated seismic source characterizations and modern ground-motion models, calculating PGA with 10 percent probability of exceedance in 50 years for reference rock conditions with $V_{s30}$ between 760 and 800 m/s [KB:benchmark.md][WEB:https://www.globalquakemodel.org/product/global-seismic-hazard-map]. For South Africa, the GEM global map indicates PGA values ranging from 0.017 g to 0.149 g for the 475-year return period, with elevated hazard observed in the Witwatersrand gold mining region where the South Deep site is located [KB:benchmark.md][WEB:https://www.globalquakemodel.org/product/global-seismic-hazard-map]. The GEM South Africa national model, developed by Midzi and colleagues at the Council for Geoscience and updated by the GEM team, forms one of the three source models employed in the SRC site-specific assessment [KB:benchmark.md][KB:psha_deep_south.md]. This national model utilizes a newly compiled earthquake catalogue extending from 1620 to 2019, incorporating data from the South African National Seismograph Network and supplemented by records from the International Seismological Centre [KB:psha_deep_south.md]. Events larger than magnitude 4 within the mining region were retained in the catalogue, as such events have caused damage both underground and at the surface, while smaller events identified with mine placenames were excluded to minimize contamination from mining-induced seismicity unrepresentative of tectonic hazard [KB:psha_deep_south.md]. The substantial increase in PGA estimates from GSHAP values below 0.01 g to GEM 2023 values approaching 0.15 g in the mining region reflects multiple factors: improved seismograph coverage enabling detection of smaller events and more accurate magnitude determination, incorporation of recent seismicity including mining-related events that may indicate tectonic stress states, updated ground-motion models developed specifically for stable continental regions, and refined seismic source characterizations incorporating neotectonic fault mapping [KB:psha_deep_south.md][WEB:https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019rg000653]. The difference between the GEM global map reference site condition of $V_{s30} = 760$ to 800 m/s and the SRC site-specific value of $V_{s30} = 600$ m/s introduces additional variability in direct comparison, as the softer site conditions at the actual facility amplify ground motions relative to the reference rock conditions, particularly at shorter structural periods [KB:psha_deep_south.md][WEB:https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019rg000653].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately presents GSHA and GEM model information from the KB sources with appropriate external citations. The GSHAP timeframe (1992-1999) and PGA estimate below 0.01 g are explicitly stated in psha_deep_south.md Section 2. The GEM 2023 global map version 2023.1 and reference site conditions of Vs30 = 760-800 m/s are documented in benchmark.md. The PGA range of 0.017 g to 0.149 g for South Africa is stated in benchmark.md. The GEM model development by Midzi et al. and Council for Geoscience is confirmed in both benchmark.md and psha_deep_south.md Section 1.2. The earthquake catalogue timeframe (1620-2019) and data sources (SANSN, ISC) are documented in psha_deep_south.md Section 3.4. The magnitude 4 threshold for mining region events and exclusion criteria for smaller mining events are explicitly stated in psha_deep_south.md Section 3.4. The WEB citations to GEM and Reviews of Geophysics provide appropriate external validation of PSHA methodology advancements. The comparison between Vs30 = 760-800 m/s (GEM) and Vs30 = 600 m/s (SRC) is factually correct based on values documented in both KB sources. All quantitative claims verified.]

## SRK Model

The SRK ground-motion intensity model represents an integrated ensemble of prediction equations developed specifically for stable continental crust environments, implemented through three region-specific logic trees corresponding to GEM, USGS, and Canadian Seismic Hazard Model configurations [KB:srkGMPE.md]. Within the GEM stable continental crust ensemble, three branches provide balanced representation of modern ground-motion characterization: the ESHM20Craton model derived from the European Seismic Hazard Model 2020 and calibrated for European and adjacent cratonic regions, the Rietbrock and Edwards 2019 model calibrated for stable crust in the United Kingdom and northern Europe, and the Shahjouei and Pezeshk 2016 model developed for central and eastern North America [KB:srkGMPE.md]. Logic-tree weights of 0.34 for ESHM20Craton and 0.33 each for Rietbrock-Edwards and Shahjouei-Pezeshk ensure that all three branches contribute approximately equally to the final hazard estimates [KB:srkGMPE.md]. The USGS stable continental crust representation employs the full NGA-East ensemble as documented in the USGS central and eastern United States hazard model, comprising seventeen Sammons branches representing weighted combinations of NGA-East candidate models derived through Sammons mapping and averaging, supplemented by six seed models corresponding to individual NGA-East candidate GMPEs including models by Graizer, Frankel, Yenier and Atkinson, and Pezeshk [KB:srkGMPE.md][WEB:https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019rg000653]. The Canadian SHM6 stable continental crust ensemble combines thirteen branches tied to different NGA-East realizations with unconditional weights summing to 0.5, supplemented by three branches based on the Atkinson and Adams 2013 model for eastern Canada representing high, central, and low median levels with weights of 0.15, 0.25, and 0.10 respectively [KB:srkGMPE.md]. Application of these three logic-tree configurations to the South Deep site yields PGA estimates that vary systematically with both site condition and model selection. For the 475-year return period and mean PGA, the GEM configuration produces values ranging from 53 to 58 cm per second squared across the $V_{s30}$ range of 180 to 1250 m per second, the SHM6 configuration yields 52 to 112 cm per second squared, and the USGS configuration gives 84 to 94 cm per second squared [KB:benchmark.md]. For the 10,000-year return period, the GEM configuration produces mean PGA values of 332 to 340 cm per second squared, SHM6 yields 208 to 348 cm per second squared, and USGS gives 358 to 386 cm per second squared [KB:benchmark.md]. Converting these values to acceleration expressed in units of gravitational acceleration yields approximate ranges of 0.05 to 0.11 g for the 475-year return period and 0.21 to 0.39 g for the 10,000-year return period, substantially lower than the SRC estimates of 0.33 g and 1.3 g for the respective return periods [KB:benchmark.md]. The systematic differences between SRK and SRC estimates reflect multiple sources of epistemic uncertainty: the selection of source models with different activity rates and maximum magnitudes, the choice of ground-motion models calibrated on different regional datasets, the treatment of site amplification effects at the $V_{s30} = 600$ m per second condition, and the inclusion or exclusion of local fault sources that may dominate hazard at short distances [KB:benchmark.md][KB:srkGMPE.md][KB:psha_deep_south.md]. The SRK ensemble emphasizes stable continental crust GMPEs developed from global datasets including European, North American, and Canadian regions, while the SRC assessment incorporates both stable continental and active crustal models to capture potential higher ground motions if local structures exhibit characteristics intermediate between stable and active regimes [KB:srkGMPE.md][KB:psha_deep_south.md][WEB:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12572-022-00325-0].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately presents the SRK ground-motion intensity model information from KB sources. The three region-specific logic trees (GEM, USGS, Canadian SHM6) are explicitly described in srkGMPE.md. The GEM ensemble composition (ESHM20Craton, Rietbrock-Edwards 2019, Shahjouei-Pezeshk 2016) and weights (0.34, 0.33, 0.33) are stated exactly as documented in srkGMPE.md. The USGS NGA-East ensemble description with seventeen Sammons branches and six seed models matches srkGMPE.md content. The Canadian SHM6 ensemble structure with thirteen NGA-East branches (weight 0.5) and three Atkinson-Adams 2013 branches (weights 0.15, 0.25, 0.10) is documented in srkGMPE.md. The PGA values from benchmark.md Table A.1 are correctly transcribed: 475-year values of 53-58, 52-112, and 84-94 cm/s^2 for GEM, SHM6, and USGS respectively, and 10,000-year values of 332-340, 208-348, and 358-386 cm/s^2. The conversion to g-units (0.05-0.11 g for 475-year, 0.21-0.39 g for 10,000-year) is mathematically correct (dividing cm/s^2 by 981 cm/s^2). The comparison with SRC values (0.33 g, 1.3 g) is accurate per benchmark.md. The discussion of epistemic uncertainty sources is consistent with content across all three KB files.
