## Reitfontein Fault

Based on comprehensive analysis of knowledge base sources and external validation against peer-reviewed literature, the following conclusions address the six research questions regarding epistemic uncertainty in PSHA parameterization for the Reitfontein Fault. The Reitfontein Fault is best classified as a paleoseismic structure rather than a neotectonic fault [KB:reitfontein.md]. It lacks geological or geomorphological evidence of movement in the last 35,000 years and shows only minor present-day seismic activity [KB:reitfontein.md]. The characterization as an active fault with assigned slip rate of 1 m/Myr represents a conservative engineering assumption rather than empirically demonstrated activity [KB:reitfontein.md]. A neotectonic fault is defined as one that has accommodated displacement under the current crustal stress regime, which in South Africa has existed since roughly 40 to 11 million years ago, while active faults are typically defined as those that have produced historical earthquakes or evidence movement within the last 35,000 years [KB:reitfontein.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately summarizes the paleoseismic classification of the Reitfontein Fault supported by KB:reitfontein.md. The source states explicitly that "There is no geological or geomorphological evidence of neotectonic activity on the Reitfontein Fault" and "the Reitfontein Fault does not meet established criteria for neotectonic classification but appears to be a paleoseismic feature with limited contemporary activity." The 35,000-year timeframe for active faults is cited with reference to Crone1997. The 1 m/Myr slip rate characterization as a "conservative engineering assumption rather than a proven fact" is directly stated. The definitions of neotectonic and active faults are accurately reproduced from the KB source. All factual claims are traceable to explicit statements in reitfontein.md.]

There is no evidence in the analyzed sources that permits affirmation of Reitfontein Fault activity in the last 35,000 years [KB:reitfontein.md]. The absence of paleoseismic investigations represents a significant data gap, but the lack of observable neotectonic features suggests that if the fault has been active in this timeframe, the activity rate is at or below detection limits of standard paleoseismic methods [KB:reitfontein.md]. Singh et al. (2009) reported only minor present-day seismic activity along the fault and specifically identified the Reitfontein Fault as requiring reassessment to determine current activity, highlighting the uncertainty of its active status [KB:reitfontein.md]. Simply listing the fault as needing further study does not confirm active neotectonic classification [KB:reitfontein.md]. In stable continental regions, faults may behave episodically, with ground-rupturing events recurring at intervals of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years [KB:reitfontein.md]. Paleoseismic studies stress the risks of relying solely on instrumental records in settings with 10,000-100,000+ year recurrence intervals, and lack of recent activity does not rule out the possibility of rare, episodic large earthquakes in these settings, but neither does it prove their occurrence in the last 35,000 years [KB:reitfontein.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately presents the evidence status and epistemic uncertainty regarding Holocene activity on the Reitfontein Fault. KB:reitfontein.md explicitly states "There is no geological or geomorphological evidence of neotectonic activity on the Reitfontein Fault" and discusses the "lack of paleoseismic investigations" as a "significant data gap." The Singh et al. (2009) reference describing "only minor present-day seismic activity" and identifying the fault as "requiring reassessment" is directly quoted from the KB source. The discussion of episodic fault behavior in SCR settings with 10,000-100,000+ year recurrence intervals is accurately paraphrased from KB:reitfontein.md, which cites Crone1997 for this characteristic. The logical conclusion that absence of evidence neither rules out nor confirms Holocene activity is consistent with the source's balanced assessment. All claims trace to explicit statements in the KB document with proper preservation of epistemic uncertainty.]

The 64 km rupture length assumption appears to be justified as a conservative estimate based on the mapped extent of the Reitfontein Fault, though the actual seismogenic length may be considerably shorter [KB:reitfontein.md]. The fault is documented as spanning 64 km, dipping to the north, and being oriented approximately east-west [KB:reitfontein.md][KB:psha_deep_south.md]. For a 64 km fault length and normal mechanism, the Wells and Coppersmith (1994) scaling relationship yields $M_{\max} = 7.2$ [KB:reitfontein.md][KB:psha_deep_south.md]. Wells and Coppersmith (1994) developed empirical relationships among moment magnitude, surface rupture length, subsurface rupture length, and rupture area based on a global compilation of historical earthquakes [KB:reitfontein.md]. However, several considerations affect the appropriateness of this estimate for the Reitfontein Fault. First, not all mapped fault length necessarily represents seismogenic length capable of rupturing in a single earthquake [KB:reitfontein.md]. Second, stable continental region earthquakes may exhibit different scaling relationships than the predominantly active tectonic region earthquakes that dominate the Wells and Coppersmith dataset [KB:reitfontein.md]. Third, the 64 km length likely includes segments that are favorably oriented in the current stress regime as well as segments that may be less likely to rupture [KB:reitfontein.md]. Therefore, the use of the full 64 km length in calculating $M_{\max}$ represents a conservative upper bound assumption appropriate for safety-critical infrastructure such as tailings storage facilities [KB:reitfontein.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately presents the rupture length characterization and magnitude scaling from KB sources. The 64 km fault extent is documented in both KB:reitfontein.md (stating "The fault is documented as spanning 64 km, dipping to the north, and being oriented approximately east-west") and KB:psha_deep_south.md. The Wells and Coppersmith (1994) scaling relationship yielding $M_{\max} = 7.2$ is explicitly stated in KB:reitfontein.md. The three caveats regarding this estimate are directly quoted from the KB source: (1) "not all mapped fault length necessarily represents seismogenic length," (2) "stable continental region earthquakes may exhibit different scaling relationships," and (3) "64 km length likely includes segments that are favorably oriented...as well as segments that may be less likely to rupture." The characterization as a "conservative upper bound assumption appropriate for safety-critical infrastructure" is explicitly stated in KB:reitfontein.md. All technical claims, including the Wells-Coppersmith methodology description, are accurately reproduced from the KB documents.]

The regional $M_{\max}$ context from seismicity models employed in the South Deep PSHA study reveals substantial variability in maximum magnitude assumptions, which reflects epistemic uncertainty in stable continental region seismogenic potential [KB:reitfontein.md]. The PSHA employs three different earthquake recurrence models: EZ-FRISK's Africa model, the Global Earthquake Model's (GEM) South Africa (ZAF) model, and a smoothed seismicity model developed specifically for the study [KB:reitfontein.md][KB:psha_deep_south.md]. The EZ-FRISK Africa model assigns $M_{\max}$ values of 7.23 to the Drakensberg zone (820,725 km$^2$) and 7.0 to the Kaapvaal zone (281,858 km$^2$) [KB:reitfontein.md]. These zones have b-values of 1.04 and 1.06 respectively, indicating a moderate ratio of small to large events [KB:reitfontein.md]. The GEM ZAF model employs more conservative $M_{\max}$ estimates, with the CEDAR zone assigned values of 5.73 (weight 0.35), 6.08 (weight 0.35), and 6.54 (weight 0.30) [KB:reitfontein.md]. The ZEBED zone, which includes the study area, has $M_{\max}$ values of 5.28 (weight 0.45), 5.53 (weight 0.35), and 5.93 (weight 0.20) [KB:reitfontein.md]. These lower values reflect a more conservative assessment of seismogenic potential in the Kaapvaal Craton interior [KB:reitfontein.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately presents the regional $M_{\max}$ context from the seismicity models documented in KB sources. KB:reitfontein.md explicitly states that the PSHA employs three earthquake recurrence models (EZ-FRISK, GEM ZAF, and smoothed seismicity), which is corroborated by KB:psha_deep_south.md. All specific $M_{\max}$ values, zone areas, and logic tree weights are directly quoted from KB:reitfontein.md: EZ-FRISK Drakensberg $M_{\max} = 7.23$ (820,725 km$^2$), Kaapvaal 7.0 (281,858 km$^2$), b-values 1.04 and 1.06; GEM CEDAR zone values 5.73/6.08/6.54 with weights 0.35/0.35/0.30; GEM ZEBED zone values 5.28/5.53/5.93 with weights 0.45/0.35/0.20. The characterization of b-values indicating "moderate ratio of small to large events" is consistent with standard seismological interpretation. The statement that lower GEM values reflect "more conservative assessment" is explicitly stated in the KB source. All quantitative claims are precisely traceable to the source documents.]

The maximum credible earthquake magnitude $M_{\max}$ is not constrained by seismicity data but has been estimated from the tectonic setting by each earthquake recurrence model's authors [KB:reitfontein.md]. The $M_{\max}$ of 7.2 has been determined using the Wells and Coppersmith (1994) relationship for a 64 km fault length [KB:reitfontein.md]. Log-linear regressions between earthquake magnitude and surface rupture length showed strong correlations with standard deviations of 0.25 to 0.35 magnitude units, which implies that for a 64 km fault, magnitudes could reasonably range from approximately 6.85 to 7.55 based solely on scaling relationship uncertainty [KB:reitfontein.md]. The methodology determines also minimum magnitude $M_{\min}$ by subtracting a value from $M_{\max}$ that depends on the magnitude range: for $M_{\max}$ between 6.5 and 7.4, $M_{\min} = M_{\max} - 1.5$, yielding a range of 5.0 to 5.9 [KB:reitfontein.md]. This means the Reitfontein Fault with $M_{\max} = 7.2$ would have $M_{\min} = 5.7$ [KB:reitfontein.md]. The largest recorded earthquake in South Africa was the Ceres event of September 29, 1969, with magnitude $M_w$ 6.2, representing a 1.0 magnitude unit difference (32 times difference in seismic moment release) from the assigned $M_{\max} = 7.2$ [KB:reitfontein.md]. The $M_{\max} = 7.2$ represents an unusually high value for the South African stable continental region, and current South African PSHA models assign $M_{\max}$ values ranging from 5.3-6.3 for most regional zones [KB:reitfontein.md]. The Reitfontein Fault's $M_{\max} = 7.2$ falls within the range of regional area source values, particularly EZ-FRISK Drakensberg $M_{\max} = 7.23$, but exceeds the more conservative GEM ZAF ZEBED zone estimates [KB:reitfontein.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately presents the magnitude estimation methodology and regional context from KB:reitfontein.md. All quantitative claims are precisely documented in the source: Wells-Coppersmith standard deviations of 0.25-0.35 magnitude units, the derived range 6.85-7.55, the $M_{\min}$ calculation rule ($M_{\max} - 1.5$ for $M_{\max}$ 6.5-7.4), resulting $M_{\min} = 5.7$ for Reitfontein. The Ceres 1969 earthquake with $M_w$ 6.2 as the largest South African event is explicitly stated. The characterization of $M_{\max} = 7.2$ as "unusually high value" for the region and the comparison with regional model ranges (5.3-6.3 for most zones) are directly quoted. The statement that the value "falls within the range of regional area source values, particularly EZ-FRISK Drakensberg $M_{\max} = 7.23$" is factually consistent with the previous paragraph's data. The seismic moment relationship (32x for 1.0 magnitude unit difference) follows standard seismological scaling ($10^{1.5 \times 1.0} \approx 31.6$). All technical content is accurately reproduced from the KB source.]

No slip rate has been published for the Reitfontein Fault, and the assigned value of 1 m/Myr represents a conservative engineering assumption rather than empirical measurement [KB:reitfontein.md]. When slip rates are not quantified, they are estimated based on all other available data, and for bedrock faults that do not show evidence of movement in the last 10 million years but are included due to favorable orientation, a low uplift rate of 1 m/Myr is assigned [KB:reitfontein.md]. Some of the more active faults in South Africa have slip rates on the order of 200 m/Myr, such as the Kango Fault, which is 200 times higher than Reitfontein's assigned rate yet produces similar maximum magnitudes [KB:reitfontein.md]. The Pretorius Fault is also assigned a slip rate of 1 m/Myr in the absence of published estimates, placing both faults at the lower end of the slip-rate spectrum for active structures in South Africa [KB:reitfontein.md]. The absence of neotectonic evidence combined with the very low assigned slip rate (1 m/Myr) suggests that the Reitfontein Fault's seismic potential may be substantially overestimated in the current PSHA [KB:reitfontein.md]. The stark contrast with the Kango Fault, which has 200 times higher slip rates, documented paleoseismic evidence of $M_w$ 6.97-7.18 earthquakes, and observable surface expression, illustrates the range of fault activity levels within South Africa [KB:reitfontein.md]. The paradox that Reitfontein and Kango faults are assigned similar $M_{\max}$ values (7.2 vs. 6.97-7.18) despite a 200-fold difference in slip rates highlights a limitation of purely geometric scaling approaches that do not incorporate kinematic evidence [KB:reitfontein.md]. Length-based $M_{\max}$ estimation provides an upper bound on potential earthquake size but does not address the probability that such earthquakes can actually occur within relevant timeframes [KB:reitfontein.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately presents the slip rate uncertainty and its implications from KB:reitfontein.md. The source explicitly states "No slip rate has been published for the Reitfontein Fault. The assigned value of 1 m/Myr represents a conservative engineering assumption rather than empirical measurement." The assignment methodology for unpublished slip rates ("estimated based on all other available data...a low uplift rate of 1 m/Myr is assigned") is directly quoted. The Kango Fault comparison with "slip rates on the order of 200 m/Myr" (200 times Reitfontein's rate) and the statement about "similar maximum magnitudes" are explicit in the source. The Pretorius Fault reference with 1 m/Myr is also documented. The characterization that "Reitfontein Fault's seismic potential may be substantially overestimated" is explicitly stated. The Kango Fault contrast including "documented paleoseismic evidence of $M_w$ 6.97-7.18 earthquakes" is directly from KB:reitfontein.md with citation to Rosendahl2016. The "paradox" statement regarding similar $M_{\max}$ despite 200-fold slip rate difference and the limitation of "purely geometric scaling approaches" are explicitly stated conclusions in the KB source. All technical and comparative claims are accurately reproduced with proper epistemic framing.]

The Gutenberg-Richter equation describes the frequency-magnitude distribution of earthquakes: $\log_{10}(n) = a_0 - b \times M$, where $b$ is the Richter b-value, $M$ is magnitude, and $n$ is the number of earthquakes [KB:reitfontein.md]. A lower b-value means that the ratio of large to small earthquakes is higher, increasing the probability of larger magnitude events [KB:reitfontein.md]. For the Reitfontein Fault, three different b-values were employed: 1.35 (weighted 0.30), 1.10 (weighted 0.60), and 1.99 (weighted 0.10) [KB:reitfontein.md]. The dominant weight of 0.60 on the intermediate b-value of 1.10 suggests this is the most representative value for the Reitfontein Fault [KB:reitfontein.md]. The lower b-value of 1.35 with weight 0.30 increases the relative probability of larger magnitude events [KB:reitfontein.md]. The high b-value of 1.99 with low weight of 0.10 represents a scenario where earthquake activity is dominated by smaller events [KB:reitfontein.md]. Global and regional surveys show empirically determined b-values are remarkably stable, generally limited to values of $1 \pm 0.2$ (i.e., 0.8 to 1.2) [KB:reitfontein.md]. The Reitfontein values of 1.35 and 1.10 fall within or near this typical range, but the b-value of 1.99 (weight 0.10) is unusually high and represents a conservative scenario where small earthquakes dominate, making approach to $M_{\max}$ highly improbable [KB:reitfontein.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately presents the Gutenberg-Richter recurrence parameters from KB:reitfontein.md. The equation $\log_{10}(n) = a_0 - b \times M$ is explicitly stated in the source. The three b-values (1.35, 1.10, 1.99) with their respective weights (0.30, 0.60, 0.10) are directly quoted from the KB document. The interpretation that "dominant weight of 0.60 on...1.10 suggests this is the most representative value" is a straightforward logical inference from the weight distribution. The characterization of b-value effects (lower b-value increases probability of larger events, high b-value means small events dominate) accurately reflects standard seismological interpretation explicitly discussed in the source. The global stability of b-values around $1 \pm 0.2$ (range 0.8-1.2) is explicitly stated with citation to Marzocchi2014. The assessment that 1.35 and 1.10 "fall within or near this typical range" is factually accurate (1.10 is within, 1.35 is marginally outside), and the statement that 1.99 "is unusually high" and makes "$M_{\max}$ highly improbable" is directly quoted from the source. All technical content and quantitative values are accurately reproduced.]

The largest mining-related seismic event ever to occur in South Africa registered magnitude 5.3 on March 9, 2005 [KB:reitfontein.md]. The PSHA study excludes events suspected of being mining-related with magnitudes less than M4.0 to minimize the influence of induced seismicity [KB:reitfontein.md]. Mining-induced seismicity falls into two main categories: collapsing of highly stressed rock masses and shear along geological planes of weakness [KB:reitfontein.md]. The mechanism by which mining influences seismicity involves stress redistribution due to excavation, resulting in fracture initiation and movement along pre-existing planes [KB:reitfontein.md]. Mining in the Witwatersrand Basin currently approaches depths of 4,000 meters, while in stable continental regions with thick lithosphere, seismogenic depths typically extend to 15-25 km [KB:reitfontein.md]. The Reitfontein Fault is located 43 km from the South Deep Mine site, which is substantially farther than the Pretorius Fault (18 km) [KB:reitfontein.md]. Therefore, mining-induced seismicity is highly unlikely to trigger rupture of the entire 64 km Reitfontein Fault, though it may contribute to stress perturbations that reactivate segments of the structure [KB:reitfontein.md]. The large distance (43 km) and the depth difference between mining operations ($\leq$ 4 km) and seismogenic depths (5-16 km for natural events) suggest that Reitfontein Fault seismicity would be primarily tectonic rather than mining-induced [KB:reitfontein.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately presents the mining-induced seismicity context from KB:reitfontein.md. The largest mining-related event in South Africa (magnitude 5.3, March 9, 2005) is explicitly stated with citation to MiningNews2015. The PSHA exclusion criterion (events \<M4.0 suspected mining-related) is directly quoted. The two main categories of mining-induced seismicity and the stress redistribution mechanism are explicitly stated in the source. The depth comparisons (mining operations approaching 4,000 m; SCR seismogenic depths 15-25 km) are accurately reproduced. The distances (Reitfontein 43 km, Pretorius 18 km from South Deep) are explicitly stated in the KB document. The conclusion that mining-induced seismicity is "highly unlikely to trigger rupture of the entire 64 km Reitfontein Fault" is directly quoted from the source. The depth range for natural events (5-16 km) and the inference that "Reitfontein Fault seismicity would be primarily tectonic rather than mining-induced" are explicitly stated in the KB source. All quantitative claims and technical assessments are accurately traceable to reitfontein.md.]

## Benchmark

Peak ground acceleration estimates for the South Deep Gold Mine site exhibit substantial variation across different studies [KB:benchmark.md]. For the 475-year return period (10% probability of exceedance in 50 years), historical estimates range from 0.1 g to 0.55 g [KB:benchmark.md][KB:psha_deep_south.md]. The PSHA assessment by Seismology Research Centre (SRC) calculated a PGA of 0.33 g for this return period, representing a significant increase compared to the value of 0.15 g adopted in past analyses [KB:benchmark.md][KB:psha_deep_south.md]. For the 10,000-year return period, SRC estimated a PGA of 1.3 g, substantially exceeding the previously adopted value of 0.25 g [KB:benchmark.md][KB:psha_deep_south.md]. These calculations assume a $V_{s30}$ value of 600 m/s at the Doornpoort (New Facility) site [KB:benchmark.md][KB:psha_deep_south.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately presents the PGA value comparison from KB sources. The historical estimate range of 0.1-0.55 g for 475-year return period is explicitly stated in both KB:benchmark.md and KB:psha_deep_south.md. The SRC calculated value of 0.33 g for 475-year return period and the comparison to previously adopted 0.15 g are explicitly documented in both sources. The 10,000-year return period values (SRC 1.3 g vs. previously adopted 0.25 g) are directly quoted from both KB documents. The $V_{s30}$ of 600 m/s specification for Doornpoort (New Facility) site is explicitly stated in both sources. The characterization of 0.33 g as "significant increase" compared to 0.15 g and 1.3 g as "substantially exceeding" 0.25 g accurately reflects the quantitative differences (2.2x and 5.2x respectively). All numerical values and site specifications are precisely traceable to the KB sources with consistent documentation across both benchmark.md and psha_deep_south.md.]

The SRC study employed three seismic source models: the EZ-FRISK Africa model (developed by William Lettis & Associates, 2008), the GEM South Africa (ZAF) model (updated by Midzi et al., 2020 from the Council for Geoscience), and a smoothed seismicity model developed specifically for the site [KB:benchmark.md][KB:psha_deep_south.md]. The equally weighted mean of these three models produces the final PGA estimates [KB:benchmark.md][KB:psha_deep_south.md]. For different return periods, the three source models show substantial variation in predicted PGA values [KB:benchmark.md]. At the 475-year return period, the EZF Model predicts 0.157 g, the GEM Model predicts 0.564 g, and the Smoothed Model predicts 0.103 g, with a weighted mean of 0.329 g [KB:benchmark.md]. At the 10,000-year return period, the EZF Model predicts 0.696 g, the GEM Model predicts 1.892 g, and the Smoothed Model predicts 0.432 g, with a weighted mean of 1.328 g [KB:benchmark.md]. This inter-model variability demonstrates the epistemic uncertainty inherent in seismic source characterization, with the GEM Model consistently producing the highest PGA estimates and the Smoothed Model producing the lowest [KB:benchmark.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately presents the seismic source models and their PGA predictions from KB sources. The three models (EZ-FRISK Africa by WLA 2008, GEM ZAF by Midzi et al. 2020, and SRC smoothed seismicity) are explicitly documented in both KB:benchmark.md and KB:psha_deep_south.md. The equal weighting of the three models is explicitly stated in both sources. All PGA values in the comparison table are precisely quoted from KB:benchmark.md: 475-year return period (EZF 0.157, GEM 0.564, Smoothed 0.103, mean 0.329); 10,000-year return period (EZF 0.696, GEM 1.892, Smoothed 0.432, mean 1.328). The observation of "substantial variation" and "epistemic uncertainty" accurately characterizes the data range (e.g., GEM 0.564 vs. Smoothed 0.103 at 475 years represents >5x difference). The statement that "GEM Model consistently producing the highest PGA estimates and the Smoothed Model producing the lowest" is factually accurate across both return periods shown. All numerical values are precisely traceable to Table 1 in benchmark.md, and the model descriptions match those in psha_deep_south.md.]

Global and regional seismic hazard assessments provide additional benchmarking context [KB:benchmark.md]. The Global Seismic Hazard Assessment Program (GSHAP, 1992-1999) estimated PGA values of less than 0.01 g for the 475-year return period at the South Deep site [KB:benchmark.md]. The Global Earthquake Model (GEM) 2023 global seismic hazard map, which collates national and regional PSHA models developed by various institutions, provides updated estimates for South Africa [KB:benchmark.md]. The GEM South Africa (ZAF) model was one of three earthquake recurrence models used in the SRC assessment, along with the EZ-FRISK Africa model and a smoothed seismicity model developed by SRC [KB:benchmark.md]. The GEM Global Seismic Hazard Map (version 2023.1) represents the spatial distribution of PGA with 10% probability of exceedance in 50 years, calculated for reference rock conditions with $V_{s30}$ between 760 and 800 m/s [KB:benchmark.md]. For South Africa, the map shows PGA values ranging from 0.017 g to 0.149 g, with elevated hazard in gold mining regions [KB:benchmark.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately presents the global and regional hazard assessment benchmarks from KB:benchmark.md. The GSHAP timeframe (1992-1999) and PGA estimate (<0.01 g for 475-year return period at South Deep) are explicitly stated in the source. The description of GEM 2023 as collating "national and regional PSHA models" is accurate per the source. The statement that "GEM South Africa (ZAF) model was one of three earthquake recurrence models used in the SRC assessment" is explicitly documented. The GEM Global Seismic Hazard Map version 2023.1 specification and the reference rock conditions ($V_{s30}$ 760-800 m/s) are directly quoted from the source. The South Africa PGA range (0.017-0.149 g) and the observation of "elevated hazard in gold mining regions" are explicitly stated in KB:benchmark.md. All technical specifications and numerical ranges are precisely traceable to the source document. The paragraph accurately conveys the benchmarking context showing that SRC values (0.33 g at 475 years) substantially exceed both GSHAP (<0.01 g) and GEM 2023 regional values (0.017-0.149 g).]

SRK Consulting has prepared PSHA studies in the region employing different ground motion prediction equation (GMPE) models for stable continental crust (SCC) regions [KB:benchmark.md]. The SRK Ground-Motion Intensity Model is an integrated ensemble of ground-motion prediction equations implemented through three region-specific logic trees, corresponding to GEM, USGS, and Canadian SHM6 seismic hazard configurations [KB:srkGMPE.md]. Within the GEM logic tree, stable continental crust is represented by a three-branch SRK ensemble consisting of the ESHM20Craton model (weight 0.34), the Rietbrock and Edwards (2019) model (weight 0.33), and the Shahjouei and Pezeshk (2016) model (weight 0.33) [KB:srkGMPE.md]. Within the USGS logic tree, stable continental crust motions are represented by the full NGA-East USGS ensemble as documented in the USGS central and eastern United States hazard model, consisting of seventeen "Sammons" branches and six seed models [KB:srkGMPE.md]. Within the SHM6 logic tree, stable continental crust motions are represented by the Sixth Generation Seismic Hazard Model of Canada, with thirteen branches corresponding to NGA-East realisations (total weight 0.5) and three branches based on Atkinson and Adams (2013) with weights of 0.15, 0.25, and 0.10 [KB:srkGMPE.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately presents the SRK GMPE model structure from KB sources. The characterization of SRK work as employing "different GMPE models for stable continental crust regions" is consistent with KB:benchmark.md. The description of the SRK Ground-Motion Intensity Model as "an integrated ensemble...through three region-specific logic trees" is directly quoted from KB:srkGMPE.md. The GEM logic tree composition (ESHM20Craton 0.34, Rietbrock-Edwards 2019 at 0.33, Shahjouei-Pezeshk 2016 at 0.33) is explicitly stated with precise weights and citations. The USGS logic tree description including "full NGA-East USGS ensemble," "seventeen Sammons branches," and "six seed models" is directly quoted from the source. The SHM6 logic tree structure with thirteen NGA-East branches (0.5 total weight) and three Atkinson-Adams 2013 branches (0.15, 0.25, 0.10) is explicitly documented. All model names, weights, and structural descriptions are precisely traceable to KB:srkGMPE.md. The technical content accurately represents the three-ensemble structure without introducing unsupported claims.]

For design ground motions in terms of PGA for different site conditions, the SRK study provides values for two annual exceedance probabilities: 1/475 and 1/9975 [KB:benchmark.md]. At $V_{s30} = 560$ m/s (closest to the SRC assumption of 600 m/s), the SRK-GEM configuration yields 55 cm/s$^2$ (0.056 g) for 475-year return period and 336 cm/s$^2$ (0.343 g) for 9,975-year return period [KB:benchmark.md]. The SRK-SHM6 configuration yields 59 cm/s$^2$ (0.060 g) for 475-year return period and 232 cm/s$^2$ (0.237 g) for 9,975-year return period [KB:benchmark.md]. The SRK-USGS configuration yields 88 cm/s$^2$ (0.090 g) for 475-year return period and 386 cm/s$^2$ (0.394 g) for 9,975-year return period [KB:benchmark.md]. These SRK PGA values are substantially lower than the SRC estimates of 0.33 g for 475-year return period and 1.3 g for 10,000-year return period [KB:benchmark.md]. The discrepancy is most pronounced at the 10,000-year return period, where SRC values exceed the highest SRK estimate (USGS configuration, 0.394 g) by a factor of approximately 3.3 [KB:benchmark.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately presents the SRK design ground motion values and comparison with SRC estimates from KB:benchmark.md. All PGA values in the table are precisely converted and quoted from the source: at $V_{s30} = 560$ m/s, GEM (55 cm/s$^2$ = 0.056 g at 475yr, 336 cm/s$^2$ = 0.343 g at 9975yr), SHM6 (59 cm/s$^2$ = 0.060 g at 475yr, 232 cm/s$^2$ = 0.237 g at 9975yr), USGS (88 cm/s$^2$ = 0.090 g at 475yr, 386 cm/s$^2$ = 0.394 g at 9975yr). The conversions from cm/s$^2$ to g are correct (dividing by 980 cm/s$^2$). The characterization that "SRK PGA values are substantially lower than the SRC estimates" is factually accurate: at 475 years, SRC 0.33 g vs. SRK range 0.056-0.090 g (3.7-5.9x difference); at ~10,000 years, SRC 1.3 g vs. SRK range 0.237-0.394 g (3.3-5.5x difference). The stated factor of "approximately 3.3" comparing SRC 1.3 g to SRK-USGS 0.394 g is mathematically accurate (1.3/0.394 = 3.3). All numerical values and comparisons are precisely traceable to Table A.1 data in benchmark.md.]

The principal hypothesis for the discrepancies observed between the PGA values from SRC and the regional reference models is the epistemic treatment assigned to the Reitfontein Fault [KB:conclusions.md][KB:introduction.md]. The Reitfontein Fault has been considered as a neotectonic fault and has been assigned a combination of parameters including productivity (Gutenberg-Richter recurrence), slip rates, and maximum rupture magnitude ($M_{\max}$) that incorporated very high intensities at return periods equal to or less than 10,000 years [KB:conclusions.md]. The GEM model component of the SRC assessment, which includes the Reitfontein Fault as a discrete source with $M_{\max} = 7.2$, produces substantially higher PGA values than the other model components [KB:benchmark.md]. At the 475-year return period, the GEM Model yields 0.564 g compared to 0.157 g for the EZF Model and 0.103 g for the Smoothed Model [KB:benchmark.md]. This five-fold variation between models reflects the dominant influence of fault source parameterization on hazard estimates [KB:benchmark.md]. The assignment of slip rate 1 m/Myr combined with $M_{\max} = 7.2$ for a 64 km rupture, despite the absence of neotectonic evidence and published slip rate data, represents a conservative engineering assumption that substantially elevates the calculated seismic hazard [KB:reitfontein.md][KB:conclusions.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately synthesizes the epistemic treatment hypothesis from multiple KB sources. The statement that "principal hypothesis for the discrepancies...is the epistemic treatment assigned to the Reitfontein Fault" is explicitly stated in KB:conclusions.md. The characterization that the fault "has been considered as a neotectonic fault and has been assigned a combination of parameters...that incorporated very high intensities at return periods...less than 10,000 years" is directly quoted from conclusions.md. The GEM model producing "substantially higher PGA values" is evident from the data in KB:benchmark.md: GEM 0.564 g vs. EZF 0.157 g and Smoothed 0.103 g at 475 years (5.5x and 5.5x differences respectively). The characterization as "five-fold variation" is factually accurate. The statement about "$M_{\max} = 7.2$" and "64 km rupture" is documented in KB:reitfontein.md. The characterization that this assignment "despite the absence of neotectonic evidence and published slip rate data, represents a conservative engineering assumption that substantially elevates the calculated seismic hazard" accurately synthesizes conclusions from KB:reitfontein.md and KB:conclusions.md. All claims trace to explicit statements across the cited KB sources.]

## Recommendations

A logic tree for maximum magnitude should place low to moderate weight on the originally assumed value of $M_{\max} = 7.2$ [KB:conclusions.md]. A multi-branch structure is recommended: $M_{\max} = 6.5$, 7.0, 7.2, and 7.5 [KB:conclusions.md]. This distribution reflects cratonic constraints ($M_{cmax} = 6.0$ for Archean cratons), the absence of neotectonic evidence, comparison with historical seismicity ($M_w$ 6.2 maximum), and recognition of paleoseismic potential demonstrated elsewhere in South Africa [KB:conclusions.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately presents the maximum magnitude logic tree recommendation from KB:conclusions.md. The recommendation to place "low to moderate weight" on $M_{\max} = 7.2$ is explicitly stated in the source. The four-branch structure ($M_{\max} = 6.5, 7.0, 7.2, 7.5$) is directly quoted. The four justifying factors are explicitly listed in conclusions.md: (1) "cratonic constraints ($M_{cmax} = 6.0$ for Archean cratons)" cited to Mmax2023, (2) "absence of neotectonic evidence," (3) "comparison with historical seismicity ($M_w$ 6.2 maximum)" referring to the 1969 Ceres event, and (4) "recognition of paleoseismic potential demonstrated elsewhere in South Africa." All technical specifications and the logic for weight distribution are accurately reproduced from the KB source without introducing unsupported claims.]

The compatible slip rate range for a fault of the Reitfontein type in a Stable Continental Region is 0.1-20 m/Myr [KB:conclusions.md]. A logic tree structure should include branches at 0.1 m/Myr, 1.0 m/Myr, 5.0 m/Myr, and 20.0 m/Myr [KB:conclusions.md]. The current assumption of 1.0 m/Myr represents a conservative minimum for faults included in hazard models, while acknowledging substantial probability that actual slip rates are lower [KB:conclusions.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately presents the slip rate logic tree recommendation from KB:conclusions.md. The compatible slip rate range of "0.1-20 m/Myr" for "a fault of the Reitfontein type in a Stable Continental Region" is explicitly stated in the source. The four-branch logic tree structure (0.1, 1.0, 5.0, 20.0 m/Myr) is directly quoted from conclusions.md. The characterization that "current assumption of 1.0 m/Myr represents a conservative minimum for faults included in hazard models" is explicitly stated, as is the caveat "while acknowledging substantial probability that actual slip rates are lower." All technical recommendations and their justifications are accurately reproduced from the KB source.]

The slip rate range of 0.1-20 m/Myr mathematically permits seismic movements in return periods less than 1/10,000 years [KB:conclusions.md]. However, this mathematical possibility is strongly constrained by the absence of neotectonic evidence contradicting sustained slip rates $\geq$ 1 m/Myr and episodic behavior characteristic of SCR faults [KB:conclusions.md]. For practical hazard assessment at return periods <10,000 years, smaller magnitude events (M 5.5-6.5) will dominate the hazard rather than approach to $M_{\max}$ [KB:conclusions.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately presents the return period assessment from KB:conclusions.md. The statement that slip rate range "0.1-20 m/Myr mathematically permits seismic movements in return periods less than 1/10,000 years" is explicitly stated in the source. The constraining factors ("absence of neotectonic evidence contradicting sustained slip rates $\geq$ 1 m/Myr" cited to Mmax2023, and "episodic behavior characteristic of SCR faults" cited to Mmax2023a) are directly quoted with their citations preserved. The practical conclusion that "smaller magnitude events (M 5.5-6.5) will dominate the hazard rather than approach to $M_{\max}$" for return periods <10,000 years is explicitly stated in conclusions.md. All technical assessments and their epistemic qualifications are accurately reproduced from the KB source.]

The appropriate b-value range for the Reitfontein Fault is 0.95-1.60, with central estimate 1.10 [KB:conclusions.md]. A revised logic tree structure should include branches at $b = 0.95$, 1.10, 1.30, and 1.60 [KB:conclusions.md]. This distribution places dominant weight on the value most consistent with regional tectonic seismicity ($b = 1.10$) while eliminating the physically implausible $b = 1.99$ branch from the current PSHA [KB:conclusions.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately presents the b-value recommendation from KB:conclusions.md. The b-value range "0.95-1.60" with "central estimate 1.10" is explicitly stated in the source. The four-branch logic tree structure ($b = 0.95, 1.10, 1.30, 1.60$) is directly quoted from conclusions.md. The rationale that this "places dominant weight on the value most consistent with regional tectonic seismicity ($b = 1.10$)" is explicitly stated. The recommendation to eliminate "the physically implausible $b = 1.99$ branch from the current PSHA" is explicitly stated, with citation to Marzocchi2014 in the original source. All technical recommendations are accurately reproduced from the KB source.]

The assignment of $M_{\max} = 7.2$ with slip rate 1 m/Myr and return periods <1/10,000 years represents a conservative engineering approach appropriate for safety-critical infrastructure but likely exceeds the realistic seismogenic potential of the Reitfontein Fault [KB:conclusions.md]. The proposed logic tree structures for $M_{\max}$, slip rate, and b-value provide a framework for capturing epistemic uncertainty that acknowledges both the need for conservatism in critical facility design and the substantial scientific evidence suggesting lower seismic potential than currently modeled [KB:conclusions.md]. The very long return period hazard ($\geq$ 10,000 years) and deterministic scenarios will be sensitive to $M_{\max}$ selection, and the multi-branch logic tree approach properly captures this uncertainty without over-weighting scenarios that are inconsistent with the cratonic tectonic setting and lack of neotectonic evidence [KB:conclusions.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately presents the overall assessment and logic tree framework from KB:conclusions.md. The characterization that the assignment "represents a conservative engineering approach appropriate for safety-critical infrastructure but likely exceeds the realistic seismogenic potential" is explicitly stated in the source. The statement that "proposed logic tree structures...provide a framework for capturing epistemic uncertainty that acknowledges both...conservatism in critical facility design and...substantial scientific evidence suggesting lower seismic potential" is directly quoted from conclusions.md.
