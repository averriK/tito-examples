The Reitfontein Fault is best classified as a paleoseismic structure rather than a neotectonic fault [KB:reitfontein.md]. It lacks geological or geomorphological evidence of movement in the last 35,000 years and shows only minor present-day seismic activity [KB:reitfontein.md]. The characterization as an active fault with assigned slip rate of 1 m/Myr represents a conservative engineering assumption rather than empirically demonstrated activity [KB:reitfontein.md]. A neotectonic fault is defined as one that has accommodated displacement under the current crustal stress regime, which in South Africa has existed since roughly 40 to 11 million years ago, while active faults are typically defined as those that have produced historical earthquakes or evidence movement within the last 35,000 years [KB:reitfontein.md].",

Singh et al. (2009) reported only minor present-day seismic activity along the fault and specifically identified the Reitfontein Fault as requiring reassessment to determine current activity, highlighting the uncertainty of its active status [KB:reitfontein.md]. Simply listing the fault as needing further study does not confirm active neotectonic classification [KB:reitfontein.md]. In stable continental regions, faults may behave episodically, with ground-rupturing events recurring at intervals of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years [KB:reitfontein.md]. Paleoseismic studies stress the risks of relying solely on instrumental records in settings with 10,000-100,000+ year recurrence intervals, and lack of recent activity does not rule out the possibility of rare, episodic large earthquakes in these settings, but neither does it prove their occurrence in the last 35,000 years [KB:reitfontein.md].",

For a 64 km fault length and normal mechanism, the Wells and Coppersmith (1994) scaling relationship yields $M_{\\max} = 7.2$ [KB:reitfontein.md][KB:psha_deep_south.md]. Wells and Coppersmith (1994) developed empirical relationships among moment magnitude, surface rupture length, subsurface rupture length, and rupture area based on a global compilation of historical earthquakes [KB:reitfontein.md]. However, several considerations affect the appropriateness of this estimate for the Reitfontein Fault. First, not all mapped fault length necessarily represents seismogenic length capable of rupturing in a single earthquake [KB:reitfontein.md]. Second, stable continental region earthquakes may exhibit different scaling relationships than the predominantly active tectonic region earthquakes that dominate the Wells and Coppersmith dataset [KB:reitfontein.md]. Third, the 64 km length likely includes segments that are favorably oriented in the current stress regime as well as segments that may be less likely to rupture [KB:reitfontein.md].

Log-linear regressions between earthquake magnitude and surface rupture length showed strong correlations with standard deviations of 0.25 to 0.35 magnitude units, which implies that for a 64 km fault, magnitudes could reasonably range from approximately 6.85 to 7.55 based solely on scaling relationship uncertainty [KB:reitfontein.md]. The methodology determines also minimum magnitude $M_{\\min}$ by subtracting a value from $M_{\\max}$ that depends on the magnitude range: for $M_{\\max}$ between 6.5 and 7.4, $M_{\\min} = M_{\\max} - 1.5$, yielding a range of 5.0 to 5.9 [KB:reitfontein.md].

When slip rates are not quantified, they are estimated based on all other available data, and for bedrock faults that do not show evidence of movement in the last 10 million years but are included due to favorable orientation, a low uplift rate of 1 m/Myr is assigned [KB:reitfontein.md]. Some of the more active faults in South Africa have slip rates on the order of 200 m/Myr, such as the Kango Fault, which is 200 times higher than Reitfontein's assigned rate yet produces similar maximum magnitudes [KB:reitfontein.md]. The Pretorius Fault is also assigned a slip rate of 1 m/Myr in the absence of published estimates, placing both faults at the lower end of the slip-rate spectrum for active structures in South Africa [KB:reitfontein.md].

The mechanism by which mining influences seismicity involves stress redistribution due to excavation, resulting in fracture initiation and movement along pre-existing planes [KB:reitfontein.md].

At $V_{s30} = 560$ m/s (closest to the SRC assumption of 600 m/s), the SRK-GEM configuration yields 55 cm/s$^2$ (0.056 g) for 475-year return period and 336 cm/s$^2$ (0.343 g) for 9,975-year return period [KB:benchmark.md]. The SRK-SHM6 configuration yields 59 cm/s$^2$ (0.060 g) for 475-year return period and 232 cm/s$^2$ (0.237 g) for 9,975-year return period [KB:benchmark.md]. The SRK-USGS configuration yields 88 cm/s$^2$ (0.090 g) for 475-year return period and 386 cm/s$^2$ (0.394 g) for 9,975-year return period [KB:benchmark.md]. These SRK PGA values are substantially lower than the SRC estimates of 0.33 g for 475-year return period and 1.3 g for 10,000-year return period [KB:benchmark.md]. The discrepancy is most pronounced at the 10,000-year return period, where SRC values exceed the highest SRK estimate (USGS configuration, 0.394 g) by a factor of approximately 3.3 [KB:benchmark.md].",

      "paragraph": "The principal hypothesis for the discrepancies observed between the PGA values from SRC and the regional reference models is the epistemic treatment assigned to the Reitfontein Fault [KB:conclusions.md][KB:introduction.md]. The Reitfontein Fault has been considered as a neotectonic fault and has been assigned a combination of parameters including productivity (Gutenberg-Richter recurrence), slip rates, and maximum rupture magnitude ($M_{\\max}$) that incorporated very high intensities at return periods equal to or less than 10,000 years [KB:conclusions.md]. The GEM model component of the SRC assessment, which includes the Reitfontein Fault as a discrete source with $M_{\\max} = 7.2$, produces substantially higher PGA values than the other model components [KB:benchmark.md]. At the 475-year return period, the GEM Model yields 0.564 g compared to 0.157 g for the EZF Model and 0.103 g for the Smoothed Model [KB:benchmark.md]. This five-fold variation between models reflects the dominant influence of fault source parameterization on hazard estimates [KB:benchmark.md]. The assignment of slip rate 1 m/Myr combined with $M_{\\max} = 7.2$ for a 64 km rupture, despite the absence of neotectonic evidence and published slip rate data, represents a conservative engineering assumption that substantially elevates the calculated seismic hazard [KB:reitfontein.md][KB:conclusions.md].",

This distribution reflects cratonic constraints ($M_{cmax} = 6.0$ for Archean cratons), the absence of neotectonic evidence, comparison with historical seismicity ($M_w$ 6.2 maximum), and recognition of paleoseismic potential demonstrated elsewhere in South Africa [KB:conclusions.md].",

The proposed logic tree structures for $M_{\\max}$, slip rate, and b-value provide a framework for capturing epistemic uncertainty that acknowledges both the need for conservatism in critical facility design and the substantial scientific evidence suggesting lower seismic potential than currently modeled [KB:conclusions.md]. The very long return period hazard ($\\geq$ 10,000 years) and deterministic scenarios will be sensitive to $M_{\\max}$ selection, and the multi-branch logic tree approach properly captures this uncertainty without over-weighting scenarios that are inconsistent with the cratonic tectonic setting and lack of neotectonic evidence [KB:conclusions.md].",
