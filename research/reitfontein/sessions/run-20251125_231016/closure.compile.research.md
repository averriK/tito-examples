# Epistemic Uncertainty in PSHA Parameterization for the Reitfontein Fault

## Classification and Activity Status

The Reitfontein Fault is best classified as a paleoseismic structure rather than a neotectonic fault based on the absence of geological or geomorphological evidence of movement in the last 35,000 years and the presence of only minor present-day seismic activity [@Reitfontein2025][@Singh2009]. Active faults are typically defined as those that have produced historical earthquakes or evidence of movement within the last 35,000 years, and the Reitfontein Fault does not meet these established criteria [@Reitfontein2025]. A neotectonic fault is defined as one that has accommodated displacement under the current crustal stress regime, which in South Africa has existed since roughly 40 to 11 million years ago [@Reitfontein2025]. There is no geological or geomorphological evidence of neotectonic activity on the Reitfontein Fault, including documented surface ruptures, displaced young sediments, geomorphic signs of recent faulting, or other markers consistent with the standard definition of an active fault [@Reitfontein2025]. The characterization as an active fault with an assigned slip rate of 1 m/Myr represents a conservative engineering assumption rather than empirically demonstrated activity [@Reitfontein2025].

The absence of paleoseismic investigations represents a significant data gap that limits definitive assessment, but the lack of observable neotectonic features suggests that if the fault has been active in this timeframe, the activity rate is at or below detection limits of standard paleoseismic methods [@Reitfontein2025][@Singh2009]. Singh et al. (2009) reported only minor present-day seismic activity along the fault and specifically identified the Reitfontein Fault as requiring reassessment to determine current activity, highlighting the uncertainty of its active status [@Singh2009]. Simply listing the fault as needing further study does not confirm active neotectonic classification [@Reitfontein2025]. Finding neotectonic evidence in old terranes in South Africa is not an easy task, though the mid-Miocene is believed to be the beginning of neotectonics in the region [@Singh2009]. In stable continental regions, faults may behave episodically, with ground-rupturing events recurring at intervals of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, meaning that lack of recent activity does not rule out the possibility of rare, episodic large earthquakes, but neither does it prove their occurrence in the last 35,000 years [@Reitfontein2025]. Paleoseismic studies stress the risks of relying solely on instrumental records in settings with 10,000-100,000+ year recurrence intervals [@Reitfontein2025].

## Rupture Length and Maximum Magnitude

The 64 km rupture length assumption appears to be justified as a conservative estimate based on the mapped extent of the Reitfontein Fault, though the actual seismogenic length may be considerably shorter [@Reitfontein2025]. The fault is documented as spanning 64 km, dipping to the north, and being oriented approximately east-west [@Reitfontein2025][@PSHADeepSouth2025]. For a 64 km fault length and normal mechanism, the Wells and Coppersmith (1994) scaling relationship yields $M_{\max} = 7.2$ [@Reitfontein2025][@PSHADeepSouth2025]. Wells and Coppersmith (1994) developed empirical relationships among moment magnitude, surface rupture length, subsurface rupture length, and rupture area based on a global compilation of historical earthquakes [@Reitfontein2025]. Log-linear regressions between earthquake magnitude and surface rupture length showed strong correlations with standard deviations of 0.25 to 0.35 magnitude units, which implies that for a 64 km fault, magnitudes could reasonably range from approximately 6.85 to 7.55 based solely on scaling relationship uncertainty [@Reitfontein2025].

However, several considerations affect the appropriateness of this estimate for the Reitfontein Fault. First, not all mapped fault length necessarily represents seismogenic length capable of rupturing in a single earthquake [@Reitfontein2025]. Second, stable continental region earthquakes may exhibit different scaling relationships than the predominantly active tectonic region earthquakes that dominate the Wells and Coppersmith dataset [@Reitfontein2025][@USGS2023NSHM]. Third, the 64 km length likely includes segments that are favorably oriented in the current stress regime as well as segments that may be less likely to rupture [@Reitfontein2025]. Therefore, the use of the full 64 km length in calculating $M_{\max}$ represents a conservative upper bound assumption appropriate for safety-critical infrastructure such as tailings storage facilities [@Reitfontein2025].

The maximum credible earthquake magnitude $M_{\max}$ is not constrained by seismicity data but has been estimated from the tectonic setting by each earthquake recurrence model's authors [@Reitfontein2025]. The methodology determines also minimum magnitude $M_{\min}$ by subtracting a value from $M_{\max}$ that depends on the magnitude range: for $M_{\max}$ between 6.5 and 7.4, $M_{\min} = M_{\max} - 1.5$, yielding a range of 5.0 to 5.9 [@Reitfontein2025]. This means the Reitfontein Fault with $M_{\max} = 7.2$ would have $M_{\min} = 5.7$ [@Reitfontein2025].

## Regional Context and Comparative Analysis

The assigned $M_{\max} = 7.2$ for the Reitfontein Fault represents an unusually high value for the South African stable continental region and substantially exceeds the largest recorded earthquake in South Africa, the Ceres event of September 29, 1969, with magnitude $M_w$ 6.2, representing a 1.0 magnitude unit difference equivalent to 32 times difference in seismic moment release [@Reitfontein2025]. Current South African PSHA models assign $M_{\max}$ values ranging from 5.3 to 6.3 for most regional zones [@Reitfontein2025][@Benchmark2025].

The regional $M_{\max}$ context from seismicity models employed in the South Deep PSHA study reveals substantial variability in maximum magnitude assumptions, which reflects epistemic uncertainty in stable continental region seismogenic potential [@Reitfontein2025]. The PSHA employs three different earthquake recurrence models: EZ-FRISK's Africa model, the Global Earthquake Model's (GEM) South Africa (ZAF) model, and a smoothed seismicity model developed specifically for the study [@Reitfontein2025][@PSHADeepSouth2025]. The EZ-FRISK Africa model assigns $M_{\max}$ values of 7.23 to the Drakensberg zone (820,725 km$^2$) and 7.0 to the Kaapvaal zone (281,858 km$^2$) [@Reitfontein2025][@Benchmark2025]. These zones have b-values of 1.04 and 1.06 respectively, indicating a moderate ratio of small to large events [@Reitfontein2025]. The GEM ZAF model employs more conservative $M_{\max}$ estimates, with the CEDAR zone assigned values of 5.73 (weight 0.35), 6.08 (weight 0.35), and 6.54 (weight 0.30) [@Reitfontein2025]. The ZEBED zone, which includes the study area, has $M_{\max}$ values of 5.28 (weight 0.45), 5.53 (weight 0.35), and 5.93 (weight 0.20) [@Reitfontein2025][@Benchmark2025]. These lower values reflect a more conservative assessment of seismogenic potential in the Kaapvaal Craton interior [@Reitfontein2025]. The Reitfontein Fault's $M_{\max} = 7.2$ falls within the range of regional area source values, particularly the EZ-FRISK Drakensberg $M_{\max} = 7.23$, but exceeds the more conservative GEM ZAF ZEBED zone estimates [@Reitfontein2025].

Regional maximum magnitude assignments for stable continental regions exhibit substantial epistemic uncertainty. The 2014 U.S. Geological Survey seismic hazard model uses weighted averages of $M$ 7.0 for cratons and $M$ 7.4 for passive margins and rifts, representing four-point probability distributions used in PSHA for the central and eastern United States and similar stable continental regions [@Petersen2014USGS]. These values acknowledge that stable continental region earthquakes of $M$ 7.5 and larger are slightly more numerous and reach slightly higher magnitudes in young passive margins and rifts than in cratons, though overall histograms of magnitude from young margins and rifts and from cratons are statistically indistinguishable [@Petersen2014USGS].

## Slip Rate Uncertainty

No slip rate has been published for the Reitfontein Fault, and the assigned value of 1 m/Myr represents a conservative engineering assumption rather than empirical measurement [@Reitfontein2025]. When slip rates are not quantified, they are estimated based on all other available data, and for bedrock faults that do not show evidence of movement in the last 10 million years but are included due to favorable orientation, a low uplift rate of 1 m/Myr is assigned [@Reitfontein2025]. Epistemic uncertainty in slip rate estimation is a fundamental challenge in stable continental region PSHA. Available fault data are insufficient in many cases or carry significant epistemic uncertainties for fault source characterization [@Stirling2020AGU]. Fault slip rate is a key parameter for seismic hazard assessment which conveys significant epistemic uncertainties to compiled data [@Stirling2020AGU].

Some of the more active faults in South Africa have slip rates on the order of 200 m/Myr, such as the Kango Fault, which is 200 times higher than Reitfontein's assigned rate yet produces similar maximum magnitudes [@Reitfontein2025]. The Pretorius Fault is also assigned a slip rate of 1 m/Myr in the absence of published estimates, placing both faults at the lower end of the slip-rate spectrum for active structures in South Africa [@Reitfontein2025]. The stark contrast with the Kango Fault, which has 200 times higher slip rates, documented paleoseismic evidence of $M_w$ 6.97-7.18 earthquakes, and observable surface expression, illustrates the range of fault activity levels within South Africa [@Reitfontein2025].

The paradox that Reitfontein and Kango faults are assigned similar $M_{\max}$ values (7.2 vs. 6.97-7.18) despite a 200-fold difference in slip rates highlights a limitation of purely geometric scaling approaches that do not incorporate kinematic evidence [@Reitfontein2025]. Length-based $M_{\max}$ estimation provides an upper bound on potential earthquake size but does not address the probability that such earthquakes can actually occur within relevant timeframes [@Reitfontein2025]. The absence of neotectonic evidence combined with the very low assigned slip rate (1 m/Myr) suggests that the Reitfontein Fault's seismic potential may be substantially overestimated in the current PSHA [@Reitfontein2025].

## Gutenberg-Richter b-value

The Gutenberg-Richter equation describes the frequency-magnitude distribution of earthquakes: $\log_{10}(n) = a_0 - b \times M$, where $b$ is the Richter b-value, $M$ is magnitude, and $n$ is the number of earthquakes [@Reitfontein2025]. A lower b-value means that the ratio of large to small earthquakes is higher, increasing the probability of larger magnitude events [@Reitfontein2025]. For the Reitfontein Fault, three different b-values were employed: 1.35 (weighted 0.30), 1.10 (weighted 0.60), and 1.99 (weighted 0.10) [@Reitfontein2025]. The dominant weight of 0.60 on the intermediate b-value of 1.10 suggests this is the most representative value for the Reitfontein Fault [@Reitfontein2025]. The lower b-value of 1.35 with weight 0.30 increases the relative probability of larger magnitude events [@Reitfontein2025]. The high b-value of 1.99 with low weight of 0.10 represents a scenario where earthquake activity is dominated by smaller events [@Reitfontein2025].

Global and regional surveys show empirically determined b-values are remarkably stable, generally limited to values of $1 \pm 0.2$ (i.e., 0.8 to 1.2) [@Reitfontein2025][@Marzocchi2014]. The Reitfontein values of 1.35 and 1.10 fall within or near this typical range, while the b-value of 1.99 (weight 0.10) is unusually high and represents a conservative scenario where small earthquakes dominate, making approach to $M_{\max}$ highly improbable [@Reitfontein2025][@Marzocchi2014].

## Mining-Induced Seismicity

Mining-induced seismicity is unlikely to trigger rupture of the entire 64 km Reitfontein Fault given the large distance of 43 km from the South Deep Mine site and the depth difference between mining operations ($\leq$ 4 km) and seismogenic depths (5-16 km for natural events) [@Reitfontein2025]. The largest mining-related seismic event ever to occur in South Africa registered magnitude 5.3 on March 9, 2005 [@Reitfontein2025]. The PSHA study excludes events suspected of being mining-related with magnitudes less than M4.0 to minimize the influence of induced seismicity [@Reitfontein2025]. Mining-induced seismicity falls into two main categories: collapsing of highly stressed rock masses and shear along geological planes of weakness [@Reitfontein2025]. The mechanism by which mining influences seismicity involves stress redistribution due to excavation, resulting in fracture initiation and movement along pre-existing planes [@Reitfontein2025]. Mining in the Witwatersrand Basin currently approaches depths of 4,000 meters, while in stable continental regions with thick lithosphere, seismogenic depths typically extend to 15-25 km [@Reitfontein2025]. The Reitfontein Fault is located 43 km from the South Deep Mine site, which is substantially farther than the Pretorius Fault (18 km) [@Reitfontein2025]. Therefore, Reitfontein Fault seismicity would be primarily tectonic rather than mining-induced, though mining may contribute to stress perturbations that reactivate segments of the structure [@Reitfontein2025].

## Peak Ground Acceleration Estimates

Peak ground acceleration estimates for the South Deep Gold Mine site exhibit substantial variation across different studies and models. For the 475-year return period (10% probability of exceedance in 50 years), the PSHA assessment by Seismology Research Centre (SRC) calculated a PGA of 0.33 g, representing a significant increase compared to historical estimates that ranged from 0.1 g to 0.55 g and the previously adopted value of 0.15 g [@Benchmark2025][@PSHADeepSouth2025]. For the 10,000-year return period, SRC estimated a PGA of 1.3 g, substantially exceeding the previously adopted value of 0.25 g [@Benchmark2025][@PSHADeepSouth2025]. These calculations assume a $V_{s30}$ value of 600 m/s at the Doornpoort (New Facility) site [@Benchmark2025][@PSHADeepSouth2025]. These values are very high for the region and substantially exceed benchmark values from regional reference models [@Conclusions2025].

The SRC study employed three seismic source models that were equally weighted to produce the final PGA estimates: the EZ-FRISK Africa model (developed by William Lettis & Associates, 2008), the GEM South Africa (ZAF) model (updated by Midzi et al., 2020 from the Council for Geoscience), and a smoothed seismicity model developed specifically for the site [@Benchmark2025][@PSHADeepSouth2025]. For the 475-year return period with site conditions of $V_{s30} = 600$ m/s and $M_w \geq 5.0$, the EZF model yielded 0.157 g, the GEM model produced 0.564 g, the smoothed model gave 0.103 g, and the weighted mean was 0.329 g [@Benchmark2025]. For the 10,000-year return period, the corresponding values were 0.696 g (EZF), 1.892 g (GEM), 0.432 g (smoothed), and 1.328 g (weighted mean) [@Benchmark2025]. This inter-model variability demonstrates the epistemic uncertainty inherent in seismic source characterization, with the GEM Model consistently producing the highest PGA estimates and the Smoothed Model producing the lowest [@Benchmark2025].

## Benchmarking Context

Regional and global seismic hazard assessments provide benchmarking context that highlights the elevated nature of the SRC estimates. The Global Seismic Hazard Assessment Program (GSHAP, 1992-1999) estimated PGA values of less than 0.01 g for the 475-year return period at the South Deep site [@Benchmark2025]. The Global Earthquake Model (GEM) 2023 global seismic hazard map, which collates national and regional PSHA models developed by various institutions, provides updated estimates for South Africa [@Benchmark2025]. The GEM Global Seismic Hazard Map (version 2023.1) represents the spatial distribution of PGA with 10% probability of exceedance in 50 years, calculated for reference rock conditions with $V_{s30}$ between 760 and 800 m/s [@Benchmark2025]. For South Africa, the map shows PGA values ranging from 0.017 g to 0.149 g, with elevated hazard in gold mining regions [@Benchmark2025][@GEM2023ZAF]. For cratonic areas specifically, benchmark studies indicate PGA values for stable regions are typically in the range 0.02-0.04 g for the 475-year return period [@SouthAfricaPGA2025][@GEM2023ZAF]. South Africa is generally considered a stable continental region due to its position relative to plate boundaries, low level of earthquake activity and slow rates of crustal deformation, with basement geology dominated by Archean cratons and mobile belts [@GEM2023ZAF]. Stable continental interiors experience markedly lower PGA hazards, with cratonic regions like the Canadian Shield typically recording PGA values below 0.1 g for a 2 percent probability [@GEM2023ZAF].

SRK Consulting has prepared PSHA studies in the region employing different ground motion prediction equation (GMPE) models for stable continental crust (SCC) regions [@Benchmark2025]. The SRK Ground-Motion Intensity Model is an integrated ensemble of ground-motion prediction equations implemented through three region-specific logic trees, corresponding to GEM, USGS, and Canadian SHM6 seismic hazard configurations [@SRKGMPE2025]. Within the GEM logic tree, stable continental crust is represented by a three-branch SRK ensemble consisting of the ESHM20Craton model (weight 0.34), the Rietbrock and Edwards (2019) model (weight 0.33), and the Shahjouei and Pezeshk (2016) model (weight 0.33) [@SRKGMPE2025]. Within the USGS logic tree, stable continental crust motions are represented by the full NGA-East USGS ensemble as documented in the USGS central and eastern United States hazard model, consisting of seventeen "Sammons" branches and six seed models [@SRKGMPE2025]. Within the SHM6 logic tree, stable continental crust motions are represented by the Sixth Generation Seismic Hazard Model of Canada, with thirteen branches corresponding to NGA-East realisations (total weight 0.5) and three branches based on Atkinson and Adams (2013) with weights of 0.15, 0.25, and 0.10 [@SRKGMPE2025].

The SRK model produces substantially lower PGA estimates than the SRC model for comparable site conditions and return periods. For the 475-year return period (10% probability of exceedance in 50 years), the SRK model yields PGA values ranging from 52 to 112 cm/s$^2$ (0.05-0.11 g) for $V_{s30}$ conditions from 180 to 1250 m/s across the three GMPE ensembles (GEM, SHM6, USGS) [@Benchmark2025]. The mean PGA values at $V_{s30} = 560$ m/s (comparable to SRC's 600 m/s) are 55 cm/s$^2$ (GEM), 59 cm/s$^2$ (SHM6), and 88 cm/s$^2$ (USGS), corresponding to 0.055 g, 0.059 g, and 0.088 g respectively [@Benchmark2025]. For the approximately 10,000-year return period (9,975 years, 0.5% probability of exceedance), the SRK model produces PGA values ranging from 208 to 386 cm/s$^2$ (0.21-0.39 g) across site conditions and GMPE ensembles [@Benchmark2025]. At $V_{s30} = 560$ m/s, the mean values are 336 cm/s$^2$ (GEM), 232 cm/s$^2$ (SHM6), and 386 cm/s$^2$ (USGS), corresponding to 0.34 g, 0.23 g, and 0.39 g respectively [@Benchmark2025].

The comparison between SRC and SRK models reveals substantial differences in hazard levels. The SRC 475-year PGA of 0.33 g is approximately 3-6 times higher than the SRK values of 0.055-0.088 g at comparable site conditions. For the 10,000-year return period, the SRC value of 1.3 g exceeds the SRK range of 0.23-0.39 g by a factor of 3.3-5.7. These differences substantially exceed typical epistemic uncertainty ranges in modern PSHA practice and point to fundamental differences in source characterization rather than GMPE selection [@OpenQuakeGMPE2022]. Recent research on stable continental region GMPEs indicates that epistemic uncertainty in ground motion models for SCR environments has been systematically addressed through ensemble approaches such as NGA-East, and typical model-to-model variability for well-calibrated SCR GMPEs is generally within a factor of 2 for median predictions [@USGS2023NSHM].

## Principal Hypothesis for Elevated Hazard

The principal hypothesis for the observed differences between the SRC PGA values and regional reference models is the epistemic treatment assigned to the Reitfontein Fault [@Conclusions2025][@Introduction2025][@Benchmark2025]. The fault has been considered as neotectonic and assigned a combination of parameters including Gutenberg-Richter productivity parameters, slip rates, and maximum rupture size ($M_{\max}$) that incorporated very high intensities for return periods equal to or less than 10,000 years [@Conclusions2025][@Benchmark2025]. The PSHA model developed by SRC is well-developed and follows state-of-the-art practices in PSHA estimation, suggesting that the model itself does not contain errors but rather that the epistemic characterization of the fault source is the dominant factor driving the elevated hazard estimates [@Conclusions2025][@Benchmark2025].

The GEM model component of the SRC assessment, which includes the Reitfontein Fault as a discrete source with $M_{\max} = 7.2$, produces substantially higher PGA values than the other model components [@Benchmark2025]. At the 475-year return period, the GEM Model yields 0.564 g compared to 0.157 g for the EZF Model and 0.103 g for the Smoothed Model [@Benchmark2025]. This five-fold variation between models reflects the dominant influence of fault source parameterization on hazard estimates [@Benchmark2025]. The assignment of slip rate 1 m/Myr combined with $M_{\max} = 7.2$ for a 64 km rupture, despite the absence of neotectonic evidence and published slip rate data, represents a conservative engineering assumption that substantially elevates the calculated seismic hazard [@Reitfontein2025][@Conclusions2025].

## Return Period Considerations

The slip rate range of 0.1-20 m/Myr mathematically permits seismic movements in return periods less than 1/10,000 years, but this mathematical possibility is strongly constrained by the absence of neotectonic evidence contradicting sustained slip rates $\geq$ 1 m/Myr and the episodic behavior characteristic of stable continental region faults [@Conclusions2025]. For practical hazard assessment at return periods less than 10,000 years, smaller magnitude events (M 5.5-6.5) will dominate the hazard rather than approach to $M_{\max}$ [@Conclusions2025].

The assignment of $M_{\max} = 7.2$ with slip rate 1 m/Myr and return periods less than 1/10,000 years represents a conservative engineering approach appropriate for safety-critical infrastructure but likely exceeds the realistic seismogenic potential of the Reitfontein Fault [@Conclusions2025]. The very long return period hazard ($\geq$ 10,000 years) and deterministic scenarios will be sensitive to $M_{\max}$ selection, and a multi-branch logic tree approach properly captures this uncertainty without over-weighting scenarios that are inconsistent with the cratonic tectonic setting and lack of neotectonic evidence [@Conclusions2025].

## Recommended Logic Tree Structures

For a logic tree structure for maximum magnitude, the originally assumed value of $M_{\max} = 7.2$ should receive low to moderate weight, with a recommended multi-branch structure including $M_{\max} = 6.5, 7.0, 7.2,$ and 7.5 [@Conclusions2025]. This distribution reflects cratonic constraints ($M_{\max} = 6.0$ for Archean cratons), the absence of neotectonic evidence, comparison with historical seismicity ($M_w$ 6.2 maximum), and recognition of paleoseismic potential demonstrated elsewhere in South Africa [@Conclusions2025].

The compatible slip rate range for a fault of the Reitfontein type in a Stable Continental Region is 0.1-20 m/Myr [@Conclusions2025]. A logic tree structure should include branches at 0.1 m/Myr, 1.0 m/Myr, 5.0 m/Myr, and 20.0 m/Myr, with the current assumption of 1.0 m/Myr representing a conservative minimum for faults included in hazard models, while acknowledging substantial probability that actual slip rates are lower [@Conclusions2025].

The appropriate b-value range for the Reitfontein Fault is 0.95-1.60, with central estimate 1.10 [@Conclusions2025]. A revised logic tree structure should include branches at $b = 0.95, 1.10, 1.30,$ and 1.60, placing dominant weight on the value most consistent with regional tectonic seismicity ($b = 1.10$) while eliminating the physically implausible $b = 1.99$ branch from the current PSHA [@Conclusions2025][@Marzocchi2014].

The revised logic tree structures for epistemic uncertainty capture the range of scientifically defensible parameterizations without over-weighting extreme scenarios [@Conclusions2025][@Marzocchi2014].

## Summary

The proposed logic tree structures for $M_{\max}$, slip rate, and b-value provide a framework for capturing epistemic uncertainty that acknowledges both the need for conservatism in critical facility design and the substantial scientific evidence suggesting lower seismic potential than currently modeled [@Conclusions2025]. Overall, the seismic hazard at the South Deep site is elevated compared to typical stable continental region values primarily due to the Reitfontein Fault parameterization rather than methodological deficiencies in the PSHA implementation [@Benchmark2025][@Conclusions2025]. The recommended multi-parameter logic tree approach allows appropriate quantification of epistemic uncertainty while avoiding over-confidence in single-point estimates that may not adequately represent the range of credible seismogenic scenarios for a paleoseismic structure with limited neotectonic evidence [@Conclusions2025][@Reitfontein2025].
