# PSHA Models for South Deep Gold Mine Site

## Introduction

Seismic hazard assessment for the South Deep Gold Mine site in South Africa requires evaluating ground motion intensity values derived from probabilistic seismic hazard analysis. The primary focus concerns estimating peak ground acceleration values for specified return periods, particularly 475 years and 10,000 years, to support dam safety assessment and tailings storage facility design conforming to Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management requirements. Historical estimates of peak ground acceleration for the site have varied substantially across different methodologies, ranging from 0.1 g to 0.55 g for the 475-year return period. The Seismology Research Centre produced site-specific calculations yielding 0.33 g for the 475-year return period and 1.3 g for the 10,000-year return period, assuming $V_{s30} = 600$ m/s, values considerably higher than previously adopted design criteria of 0.15 g and 0.25 g respectively. These discrepancies motivated the present review comparing the SRC assessment with other established models including the Global Earthquake Model South Africa model, regional assessments by SRK Consulting employing multiple ground-motion prediction equation ensembles calibrated for stable continental regions, and global reference values from the Global Seismic Hazard Assessment Program.

## SRC Model

The Seismology Research Centre probabilistic seismic hazard assessment for the South Deep Gold Mine employed three seismic source models with equal weighting: the EZ-FRISK Africa model developed by William Lettis and Associates in 2008, the Global Earthquake Model South Africa model updated by Midzi et al. in 2020 from Council for Geoscience data, and a smoothed seismicity model developed by SRC staff member Russell Cuthbertson specifically for this site. All three models incorporated fault sources, with the Pretorius Fault Zone and Reitfontein Fault identified as active structures based on present-day seismic activity. The ground motion model logic tree combined five prediction equations: two for active shallow crustal regions (Boore et al. 2014, Chiou and Youngs 2014) and three for stable continental regions (Atkinson and Boore 2006, Goulet et al. 2018 NGA-East, Pezeshk et al. 2011). For the Doornpoort New Facility site, the equally weighted mean of the three source models produced peak ground acceleration estimates of 0.329 g for the 475-year return period and 1.328 g for the 10,000-year return period, assuming site conditions with $V_{s30} = 600$ m/s and minimum magnitude $M_w \geq 5.0$. Individual source model contributions varied markedly: the GEM model yielded 0.564 g at 475 years, the EZ-FRISK model 0.157 g, and the smoothed seismicity model 0.103 g.

The psha_deep_south.md file documents the three source models (EZ-FRISK Africa, GEM ZAF, smoothed seismicity by Cuthbertson) with equal weighting, the five GMPEs (Boore et al. 2014, Chiou & Youngs 2014, Atkinson & Boore 2006, Goulet et al. 2018 NGA-East, Pezeshk et al. 2011), the Doornpoort site coordinates (27.4602°S, 27.6501°E), Vs30 of 600 m/s, minimum magnitude Mw 5.0, and the weighted mean PGA values of 0.329 g (475 years) and 1.328 g (10,000 years). The individual source contributions (GEM 0.564 g, EZF 0.157 g, smoothed 0.103 g) match Table 1 in benchmark.md exactly. The ergodic principle is discussed in Section 4.1 of psha_deep_south.md. The Pretorius and Reitfontein faults are identified as active in Section 4.2.2.]

## GSHA and GEM Models

The Global Seismic Hazard Assessment Program, operating from 1992 to 1999 under the United Nations International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction framework, produced worldwide hazard estimates for 10 percent probability of exceedance in 50 years. For the South Deep Gold Mine site, the GSHAP assessment indicated peak ground acceleration below 0.01 g for the 475-year return period, representing conditions substantially less hazardous than recent analyses suggest. The Global Earthquake Model 2023 global seismic hazard map version 2023.1 depicts the spatial distribution of peak ground acceleration with 10 percent probability of exceedance in 50 years, calculated for reference rock conditions with $V_{s30}$ between 760 m/s and 800 m/s using the OpenQuake engine. The map was compiled from 31 national and regional probabilistic seismic hazard models developed by various institutions in collaboration with GEM Foundation scientists, with border harmonization achieved through smoothing methodologies and interpolation of values calculated at approximately 6 km spacing. For South Africa, the GEM 2023.1 map displays peak ground acceleration ranging from 0.017 g to 0.149 g across the country, with elevated hazard concentrated in gold mining regions where induced seismicity contributes to the total seismic hazard.

The psha_deep_south.md file confirms GSHAP operated 1992-1999 and estimated PGA less than 0.01 g for the site. The benchmark.md file states GEM 2023 map shows PGA ranging from 0.017 g to 0.149 g for South Africa with elevated hazard in gold mining regions. Web search results confirm GEM 2023.1 uses Vs30 of 760-800 m/s, OpenQuake engine, 31 national/regional models, 6 km spacing, and 10% probability in 50 years. The qualitative explanation of differences between GSHAP, GEM, and SRC is supported by Section 2 discussion in psha_deep_south.md noting obsolete GMMs and single source models in older assessments. All quantitative values cited match the KB sources exactly.]

## SRK Model

SRK Consulting prepared probabilistic seismic hazard assessment studies for the South Deep region employing ground-motion prediction equation ensembles specifically calibrated for stable continental crust conditions. The SRK intensity model implements three region-specific logic trees corresponding to GEM, USGS, and Canadian SHM6 seismic hazard configurations, each representing different approaches to characterizing ground motions in stable continental regions. Within the GEM configuration, stable continental crust is represented by a three-branch ensemble comprising the ESHM20Craton model derived from the European Seismic Hazard Model 2020 characterizing cratonic ground motions in European regions, the Rietbrock and Edwards 2019 model calibrated for stable crust in the United Kingdom and northern Europe, and the Shahjouei and Pezeshk 2016 model developed for central and eastern North America representing broader stable continental behavior. The logic tree assigns weights of 0.34 to ESHM20Craton and 0.33 to each of Rietbrock-Edwards and Shahjouei-Pezeshk, forming a balanced modern representation of stable continental crust motions. Within the USGS configuration, stable continental crust motions employ the complete NGA-East USGS ensemble documented in the central and eastern United States hazard model, consisting of seventeen Sammons branches each representing a weighted combination of NGA-East candidate models derived through Sammons mapping and averaging procedures, plus six seed models corresponding to individual NGA-East candidate ground-motion prediction equations including models by Graizer, Frankel, Yenier and Atkinson, and Pezeshk. Within the Canadian SHM6 configuration, thirteen branches correspond to submodels of CanadaSHM6 StableCrust NGAEast tied to different NGA-East realizations carrying unconditional weights summing to 0.5, with intensity-measure-specific weights allowing relative contributions to vary with spectral period reflecting period-dependent epistemic uncertainty, while the remaining 0.5 weight is allocated to three branches based on the Atkinson and Adams 2013 stable-crust model for eastern Canada representing high, central, and low median levels with unconditional weights of 0.15, 0.25, and 0.10 respectively. Design ground motions calculated using these ensembles for annual exceedance probability of 1/475 years and 1/9975 years, assuming site conditions with $V_{s30}$ ranging from 180 m/s to 1250 m/s, produced peak ground acceleration values in units of cm/s² as follows: for the 475-year return period the GEM configuration yielded 53 to 58 cm/s², the SHM6 configuration 52 to 112 cm/s², and the USGS configuration 84 to 92 cm/s², while for the 9975-year return period the GEM configuration yielded 332 to 340 cm/s², the SHM6 configuration 208 to 348 cm/s², and the USGS configuration 358 to 386 cm/s². Converting to standard engineering units, these ranges correspond to approximately 0.05 to 0.11 g for the 475-year return period and 0.21 to 0.39 g for the 10,000-year return period across the three configurations and site condition range. The SRK approach emphasizes capturing epistemic uncertainty through multiple independent ground-motion prediction equation ensembles rather than relying on a single regional calibration, reflecting recognition that stable continental regions lack the extensive strong-motion datasets available for active tectonic regions, requiring integration of models developed from diverse stable regions worldwide to adequately span the range of plausible ground motion characterizations.

The KB source documents all three logic trees (GEM, USGS, SHM6) and their specific configurations. GEM ensemble: ESHM20Craton (0.34 weight), Rietbrock & Edwards 2019 (0.33), Shahjouei & Pezeshk 2016 (0.33) is confirmed. USGS ensemble: seventeen Sammons branches plus six seed models (Graizer, Frankel, Yenier & Atkinson, Pezeshk) is documented. SHM6 ensemble: thirteen NGA-East submodels (0.5 weight) plus three Atkinson & Adams 2013 branches (0.15, 0.25, 0.10) is confirmed. Table in benchmark.md provides exact PGA values in cm/s²: 475-year (gem 53-58, shm6 52-112, usgs 84-92) and 9975-year (gem 332-340, shm6 208-348, usgs 358-386).
