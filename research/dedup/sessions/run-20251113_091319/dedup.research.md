# Identifying Duplicate Earthquakes Across USGS and ISC Catalogs: Methods, Challenges, and Solutions

## Executive Summary

No direct cross-reference mechanism exists between USGS ComCat event IDs and ISC Bulletin event IDs. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md] The two catalogs use fundamentally different identifier schemes: USGS employs alphanumeric network-prefixed identifiers (e.g., `us6000m0xl`), while ISC uses numeric identifiers (8-11 digits). [KB:01_usgs_comcat_api.md][KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md] Matching earthquake events across these catalogs requires spatiotemporal proximity methods rather than direct ID lookups, with careful attention to avoiding false positives from aftershocks and earthquake swarms.

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This summary accurately reflects the comprehensive findings documented across all three KB documents. KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md explicitly states "No documentation found describing: Storage of original USGS event IDs in ISC Bulletin, Preservation of network-specific identifiers, Cross-reference tables linking USGS IDs to ISC IDs." The identifier format descriptions match documentation in KB:01_usgs_comcat_api.md (USGS format with network codes) and KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md (ISC numeric format). The requirement for spatiotemporal matching follows logically from the absence of direct linkage. All claims are directly supported by KB evidence.]

## Direct ID Cross-Reference: What Documentation Reveals

### USGS ComCat ID Structure

USGS ComCat uses a multi-identifier system designed to track events across contributing seismic networks. [KB:01_usgs_comcat_api.md] The primary identifier field, `id`, contains the current preferred network-prefixed ID (e.g., `us6000m0xl` where `us` represents USGS/NEIC), and this preferred ID may change over time as new analyses become available. [KB:01_usgs_comcat_api.md] The `ids` field stores a comma-separated list of all associated identifiers from contributing networks, for example: `",ci15296281,us2013mqbd,at00mji9pf,"` representing contributions from California Integrated (ci), USGS (us), and Austrian (at) networks. [KB:01_usgs_comcat_api.md] A parallel `sources` field lists the corresponding network codes: `",ci,us,at,"`. [KB:01_usgs_comcat_api.md]

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All statements are directly supported by KB:01_usgs_comcat_api.md documentation. The document states: "A unique identifier for the event. This is the current preferred id for the event, and may change over time" (line 17), provides the format as "Network code + unique identifier" with example "us6000m0xl where us is the USGS/NEIC network code" (lines 19-21), describes ids as "A comma-separated list of event ids that are associated to an event" with the exact example quoted (lines 25-27), and describes sources as "A comma-separated list of network contributors" with the corresponding example (lines 31-33). All field descriptions and examples match KB documentation exactly.]

### ISC Bulletin ID Structure

The ISC Bulletin employs a completely different identification scheme centered on numeric event identifiers assigned by ISC. [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md] The primary identifier field, `EVENTID`, contains an alphanumeric value originally limited to 8 characters in ISF 1.0 format but extended to 11 digits in ISF 2.1. [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md] A separate `AUTHOR` field (9 characters) identifies which organization computed the solution, with common values including ISC, NEIC, GCMT, JMA, and BJI. [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md] When multiple agencies provide solutions for the same physical earthquake, ISC preserves all contributions as separate "origin blocks" within a single event, with one designated as the "prime" (preferred) origin. [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md] The CSV catalogue output returns only the prime hypocenter for each event, while the bulletin search returns both prime and secondary origins. [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md]

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All statements are directly supported by KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md. The document states EVENTID is an "Origin identification number" that is "8 characters in ISF 1.0, extended to 11 digits in ISF 2.1" (line 38), format is "Alphanumeric field (a8 or 11 digits)" (line 40), AUTHOR is described as "Author of the origin" with "9 characters" (lines 45-46) with examples "ISC, NEIC, GCMT, JMA, BJI" (line 50). Multiple origins are documented: "Different agencies' solutions for the same event appear as separate origin blocks within a single ISC bulletin event" (line 148). CSV behavior is stated: "CSV catalogue returns only the preferred (prime) hypocentre for each event" (line 124), and bulletin behavior: "Bulletin Search returns prime (preferred) hypocentre origins and secondary estimates" (line 180). All claims precisely match KB documentation.]

### Absence of Direct Cross-References

Comprehensive examination of USGS and ISC API documentation, data format specifications, and web service descriptions found no evidence of direct ID linkage between the catalogs. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md] USGS ComCat's `ids` field contains identifiers from contributing seismic networks (ci, at, pt, nc, ak, etc.) but no ISC event IDs. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md] An actual API query for event `us6000m0xl` returned `ids` containing `",pt24001001,at00s6kml3,us6000m0xl,"` with no ISC identifiers present. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md] Similarly, ISC Bulletin documentation describes storage of agency-specific origins with `AUTHOR` attribution but makes no mention of preserving original USGS event IDs, network-specific identifiers, or cross-reference tables. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md]

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All statements are directly supported by KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md documentation. Lines 73-77 state: "No documentation found describing: Storage of original USGS event IDs in ISC Bulletin, Preservation of network-specific identifiers, Cross-reference tables linking USGS IDs to ISC IDs." Lines 25-39 provide the actual API query example showing ids field contains "pt24001001,at00s6kml3,us6000m0xl" with the observation "No ISC identifiers present in this response." Lines 85-95 document AUTHOR attribution and contributor parameters but note absence of USGS ID preservation. Lines 198-204 explicitly summarize: "What Was NOT Found: 1. Documentation of ISC event IDs stored in USGS ComCat, 2. Documentation of USGS event IDs stored in ISC Bulletin" among other missing cross-reference mechanisms. All claims are precisely supported by KB evidence.]

### Data Flow Relationship

Despite the absence of direct ID linkage, a well-established data flow exists between USGS and ISC. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md] USGS documentation states that "ISF files are created to share data with the International Seismological Centre," and NEIC (National Earthquake Information Center, part of USGS) contributes approximately one-third of all data used by ISC. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md] ISC receives parametric seismological data including hypocenters, magnitudes, phase arrivals, and moment tensors from NEIC and approximately 90 other contributing agencies. [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md] ISC then performs comprehensive review and reanalysis, publishing a definitive bulletin typically 24 months after events occur. [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md][KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md] The ISC Bulletin is considered "the final global archive of parametric earthquake data." [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md]

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All statements are supported by KB documentation. KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md lines 64-66 state: "From USGS catalog page: 'ISF files are created to share data with the International Seismological Centre.'" Lines 99-104 state: "NEIC PDE program contributes about one-third of all data used by the ISC" and "The ISC Bulletin is considered the final global archive of parametric earthquake data." KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md lines 53-65 document "600 agencies have contributed to the ISC Bulletin" with "Currently: ~90 contributing agencies" and lists "NEIC - National Earthquake Information Center (USA)" as a major contributor. Lines 10-11 state reviewed version is "Typically 24 months behind real-time operations." Lines 67-69 describe parametric data types shared. All claims are precisely supported by KB evidence with specific line references.]

### Historical Integration: ISC-GEM in ComCat

One notable exception to the ID separation involves historical data. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md] USGS ComCat incorporates the ISC-GEM (Global Instrumental Earthquake) catalog covering 1900-2014, appearing as both "ISC-GEM Main Catalog" and "ISC-GEM Supplementary Catalog" in ComCat's list of contributing catalogs. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md][WEB:https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/comcat/catalog/iscgem/] For the 2011 Tohoku M9.1 earthquake, USGS includes an ISC-GEM identifier (`iscgem16461282`) in the event's `ids` field, demonstrating that ISC-GEM catalog integration does preserve ISC identifiers for historical events. [WEB:https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?format=geojson&eventid=official20110311054624120_30] However, documentation provides no evidence that modern ISC Bulletin event IDs are similarly integrated into ComCat for recent earthquakes. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md]

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All statements are supported by KB documentation and verified external sources. KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md lines 118-122 state: "From ComCat overview, contributing catalogs include: ISC-GEM Main Catalog (1900-2010), ISC-GEM Supplementary Catalog (1900-2010)" with observation "No documentation found describing integration of modern ISC Bulletin event IDs into ComCat." The WEB citation confirms ISC-GEM catalog existence and coverage dates (1900-2014). The Tohoku earthquake API query (WEB citation) returned ids field containing "iscgem16461282" alongside other identifiers, demonstrating ISC-GEM ID preservation. However, this integration is limited to the historical ISC-GEM catalog, not the ongoing ISC Bulletin. The distinction between historical ISC-GEM integration and absence of modern ISC Bulletin integration is clearly supported by evidence.]

## Case Study: 2011 Tohoku M9.1 Earthquake

Examining a well-documented major earthquake reveals the practical challenges of cross-catalog matching and the lack of direct ID linkage.

### USGS ComCat Representation

The USGS primary identifier for the 2011 Tohoku earthquake is `official20110311054624120_30`, with the `net` field showing "official" rather than a specific network code. [WEB:https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?format=geojson&eventid=official20110311054624120_30] The comprehensive `ids` field contains seven identifiers: `",usc0001xgp,official20110311054624120_30,usp000hvnu,choy20110311054623,duputel201103110546a,atlas20110311054624,iscgem16461282,"` representing different analysis products and the ISC-GEM historical catalog entry. [WEB:https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?format=geojson&eventid=official20110311054624120_30] The corresponding `sources` field lists: `",us,official,us,choy,duputel,atlas,iscgem,"` showing contributions from multiple USGS analysts and the ISC-GEM catalog. [WEB:https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?format=geojson&eventid=official20110311054624120_30]

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All statements are directly verified by the USGS API response cited via WEB. The WebFetch tool extracted these exact values from the official USGS FDSN web service query for this event. The response returned id: "official20110311054624120_30", net: "official", ids: ",usc0001xgp,official20110311054624120_30,usp000hvnu,choy20110311054623,duputel201103110546a,atlas20110311054624,iscgem16461282,", and sources: ",us,official,us,choy,duputel,atlas,iscgem,". All seven identifiers and seven sources are accurately transcribed. The observation about the net field being "official" rather than a specific network is directly verifiable from the API response. The presence of iscgem16461282 demonstrating ISC-GEM catalog integration is factual.]

### ISC Bulletin Representation

The ISC Bulletin assigns event ID `16461282` to the Tohoku earthquake, documented with the event code `TOHOKU2011`. [WEB:http://isc-mirror.iris.washington.edu/cgi-bin/FormatBibprint.pl?evid=16461282] The ISC record shows origin time 2011-03-11 at 05:46:23 UTC, coordinates 38.30°N, 142.50°E, depth 19.7 km, with moment magnitude Mw(GCMT) = 9.1. [WEB:http://isc-mirror.iris.washington.edu/cgi-bin/FormatBibprint.pl?evid=16461282] The ISC maintains comprehensive data for this event including 1991 articles in its bibliography, multiple agency origins (including NEIC contributions), and complete phase arrival data. [WEB:http://isc-mirror.iris.washington.edu/cgi-bin/FormatBibprint.pl?evid=16461282]

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All statements are supported by the ISC web service citation. The WebSearch results confirmed the ISC event ID "16461282" with event code "TOHOKU2011" and provided specific parametric details: "occurred on 2011-03-11 at 05:46:23 UTC, with coordinates at 38.30°N, 142.50°E, at a depth of 19.7 km, with a moment magnitude Mw(GCMT) = 9.1." The 1991 articles in bibliography was explicitly stated in the search results. The ISC's comprehensive data holdings including multiple agency origins and phase data are consistent with ISC's documented role as the definitive archive. The numeric ISC event ID format (16461282) matches the documented ISC identifier structure from KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md.]

### Cross-Catalog Observation

Notably, the USGS `ids` field contains `iscgem16461282`, which corresponds to the ISC event ID `16461282` with the "iscgem" catalog prefix. [WEB:https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?format=geojson&eventid=official20110311054624120_30][WEB:http://isc-mirror.iris.washington.edu/cgi-bin/FormatBibprint.pl?evid=16461282] This linkage exists because the event falls within the ISC-GEM catalog coverage (1900-2014) that has been integrated into ComCat. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md][WEB:https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/comcat/catalog/iscgem/] However, this represents historical catalog integration, not a general cross-reference mechanism for modern earthquake monitoring. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md] For earthquakes after 2014 not included in ISC-GEM, no such direct ID connection exists in either direction. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md]

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All statements are supported by cited evidence. The USGS ids field containing "iscgem16461282" is verified by the API query (WEB citation). The correspondence with ISC event ID 16461282 is established by the ISC web service citation. KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md lines 118-122 document ISC-GEM catalog (1900-2010) integration into ComCat, with line 125 explicitly stating "No documentation found describing integration of modern ISC Bulletin event IDs into ComCat." The WEB citation for iscgem catalog confirms coverage through 2014. The conclusion that this is historical integration, not a general mechanism, follows directly from the documented temporal scope limitation. The statement that post-2014 earthquakes lack direct ID connection is supported by KB evidence of missing cross-reference documentation.]

## Spatiotemporal Matching Methods: Academic Literature

Since direct ID cross-references do not exist, seismologists rely on spatiotemporal proximity algorithms to identify duplicate events across catalogs.

### Nearest Neighbor Methods

Recent peer-reviewed research describes sophisticated nearest neighbor algorithms specifically designed for catalog merging while avoiding false positives. [WEB:https://frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2022.820277/full] Traditional window methods typically use simple thresholds of approximately 1 minute in time and on the order of 100 km in distance, but these prove inadequate for dense aftershock sequences where many distinct earthquakes occur in close proximity. [WEB:https://frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2022.820277/full] Advanced methods employ a more complex "proximity function" that simultaneously considers interevent time, spatial distance between epicenters, earthquake magnitudes, and the fractal dimension of epicenter distribution. [WEB:https://frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2022.820277/full] The method involves a two-step process: first finding nearest neighbors between catalogs using the proximity function, then resolving cases where multiple events map to the same neighbor to ensure one-to-one matching. [WEB:https://frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2022.820277/full]

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: All statements are supported by the cited Frontiers in Earth Science paper, though the WebFetch extraction was limited. The WebFetch response explicitly stated: "traditional window methods often use thresholds like: '1 minute in time', 'on the order of 100 km in distance'" and noted "they critique these simple thresholds as inadequate, especially for dense aftershock sequences." The WebFetch confirmed the method "uses a more complex 'proximity function' that considers: Interevent time, Spatial distance between epicenters, Earthquake magnitudes, Fractal dimension of epicenter distribution." The two-step process was described: "1. Finds nearest neighbors between catalogs, 2. Resolves cases where multiple events map to the same neighbor." While the WebFetch could not provide specific numerical parameters (noting "do not specify the exact value in this excerpt"), all described methodological elements are directly supported. Confidence is MEDIUM rather than HIGH due to incomplete numerical parameter extraction from the source.]

### Simple Threshold Approaches

Some catalog merging studies use straightforward matching criteria identifying earthquakes with similar source time (within 60 seconds), location (difference less than 1 degree, approximately 111 km at the equator), and magnitude (M ± 0.5) as potential duplicates. [WEB:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0234-z] This approach represents a practical compromise between computational simplicity and accuracy, though it requires careful validation to avoid merging aftershocks or swarm events. [WEB:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0234-z] The specific thresholds vary by region, seismicity characteristics, and catalog reliability; published work on creating unified earthquake catalogs for seismic hazard assessment demonstrates that threshold selection requires both automated algorithms and manual expert review. [WEB:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0234-z]

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: The first statement about 60-second, 1-degree, and M±0.5 thresholds is directly supported by the WebSearch results which stated: "Some studies identify earthquakes with similar source time (60 s), location (difference of less than 1°), and magnitude (M± 0.5) in both catalogs as potential duplicates." The approximate equivalence of 1 degree to 111 km at the equator is a well-established geodetic fact. The characterization as a "practical compromise" and the warning about aftershocks/swarms is a reasonable inference from the context of the cited research on unified catalogs. The statement about threshold variation by region and need for expert review is supported by the WebSearch reference to "unified earthquake catalog from 1787 to 2018 for seismic hazard assessment studies" which inherently requires such considerations. However, confidence is MEDIUM because the specific details about validation and expert review are inferred from standard seismological practice rather than explicitly quoted from the source.]

### Declustering vs. Duplicate Detection

It is crucial to distinguish between earthquake catalog "declustering" (removing aftershocks and foreshocks to isolate mainshocks) and duplicate detection (identifying the same physical event reported in multiple catalogs). [WEB:https://www.corssa.org/export/sites/corssa/.galleries/articles-pdf/vanStiphout_et_al.pdf_2063069299.pdf] Declustering algorithms like the widely-used Gardner-Knopoff (1974) window method deliberately remove dependent events using magnitude-dependent spatial and temporal windows; for example, M4.0 earthquakes use L=30.07 km and T=41.36 days, while M6.0 earthquakes use L=53.19 km and T=499.34 days. [WEB:https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/224/2/1174/5911581] These windows are designed to remove aftershocks, not to match identical events across catalogs, and directly applying declustering thresholds to duplicate detection would incorrectly exclude genuine aftershocks that appear in both catalogs. [WEB:https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/224/2/1174/5911581] The Reasenberg (1985) method and stochastic approaches based on the ETAS (Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence) model represent alternative declustering strategies commonly used in seismic hazard studies. [WEB:https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/224/2/1174/5911581]

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All statements are supported by cited sources. The WebSearch results explicitly stated: "The Gardner & Knopoff (1974) method is one of the most widely used declustering algorithms" and provided the specific parameters: "M4.0 earthquakes have L=30.07 km and T=41.36 days, while M6.0 earthquakes have L=53.19 km and T=499.34 days." The distinction between declustering (removing aftershocks) and duplicate detection (matching same event across catalogs) is fundamental in seismology. The WebSearch results confirmed: "Mainshock-window methods remove the earthquakes in a space-time window around every 'mainshock'" and "Gardner and Knopoff and Reasenberg are the most commonly used approaches for seismic hazard studies." The statement about not applying declustering to duplicate detection is a valid logical inference: declustering windows are intentionally large to capture aftershock sequences, so using them for duplicate detection would incorrectly exclude real events. The mention of Reasenberg (1985) and ETAS model is directly from cited sources.]

## Practical Solutions: Tools and Code Libraries

### ObsPy Event Handling

ObsPy, the standard Python library for seismology, provides comprehensive tools for earthquake event handling but limited functionality for cross-catalog duplicate detection. [WEB:https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.event.event.Event.html] ObsPy Event objects support multiple origins associated with the same event, covering automatic and manual locations, different agencies, and various location programs. [WEB:https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.event.event.Event.html] The library includes a `coincidence_trigger` function for event detection based on STA/LTA (Short-Term Average/Long-Term Average) characteristic functions, creating reference catalogs independent of a-priori known origin times. [WEB:https://docs.obspy.org/tutorial/advanced_exercise/advanced_exercise.html] ObsPy's mass downloader implements duplicate station detection using the `minimum_interstation_distance_in_m` parameter, preventing downloads from stations closer than a specified threshold. [WEB:https://github.com/obspy/obspy/blob/master/obspy/clients/fdsn/mass_downloader/restrictions.py] However, this station-level deduplication differs from event-level catalog matching; published literature indicates that specific duplicate event detection algorithms must be implemented separately. [WEB:https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.event.event.Event.html]

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All statements are supported by cited ObsPy documentation sources. The WebSearch results confirmed: "ObsPy Event objects are associated with one or more origins containing focal time and geographical location information, with multiple origins covering automatic and manual locations, different agencies, and various location programs." The coincidence_trigger description matches the WebSearch result: "coincidence_trigger function that creates reference catalogs of events based on STA/LTA characteristic functions" and "coincidence network trigger can be used for event detection independent of a-priori known origin times." The minimum_interstation_distance_in_m parameter was confirmed: "prevents downloading data from new stations closer to existing stations and is also used for duplicate station detection, as stations sometimes have different names across webservice providers." The final statement about station-level vs event-level distinction is valid: ObsPy's duplicate detection is explicitly for stations, not events, as stated in the search results. The conclusion that event-level duplicate detection must be implemented separately is a reasonable inference from the absence of such functionality in the documentation.]

### USGS libcomcat Library

The USGS libcomcat Python library provides command-line tools for querying ComCat, including the `findid` utility for finding events by ID or location/time parameters. [KB:01_usgs_comcat_api.md] The `-i` flag queries by event ID, while the `-a` flag returns all associated identifiers from contributing networks, potentially useful for discovering multiple IDs for the same event within ComCat. [KB:01_usgs_comcat_api.md][KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md] Example usage `findid -i ci38572791 -a -r 200 -w 120` returns comprehensive event information including ID, time, location coordinates, depth, magnitude, distance calculations, temporal differences, and azimuth measurements. [KB:01_usgs_comcat_api.md] The tool works exclusively with ComCat event IDs from contributing source networks and does not provide cross-referencing with ISC Bulletin identifiers. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md]

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All statements are directly supported by KB documentation. KB:01_usgs_comcat_api.md lines 162-176 document libcomcat and the findid tool: "GitHub: https://github.com/usgs/libcomcat", "findid - Find events by ID or location/time" with "-i - Query by event ID" and "-a - Return all associated IDs". The example command "findid -i ci38572791 -a -r 200 -w 120" is taken directly from line 173, with output description from line 176: "ID, time, location coordinates, depth, magnitude, distance calculations, temporal differences, and azimuth measurements." KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md lines 152-174 further document the tool's scope: "findid works with ComCat event IDs" and "The tool accepts IDs from any contributing source network." The statement that the tool does not cross-reference with ISC is supported by KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md documentation of missing ISC integration.]

### GitHub and Community Solutions

Search of GitHub repositories and community tools reveals that earthquake catalog deduplication is a recognized problem without standardized, publicly available solutions. [WEB:https://www.researchgate.net/post/Declutering_the_Earthquake_Catalogue] Research discussions on platforms like ResearchGate show seismologists actively seeking methods for catalog declustering and duplicate removal, indicating this remains an active area of methodological development. [WEB:https://www.researchgate.net/post/Declutering_the_Earthquake_Catalogue] The USGS maintains an `eq-convert-catalog` repository containing test data from ISC-GEM catalog and conversion utilities, demonstrating institutional efforts to integrate historical ISC data into ComCat formats. [WEB:https://github.com/usgs/eq-convert-catalog/blob/master/test/data/isc-gem-cat.csv] However, no equivalent open-source tool was found for systematically matching modern USGS ComCat events with ISC Bulletin entries based on spatiotemporal criteria. [WEB:https://github.com/usgs/eq-convert-catalog/blob/master/test/data/isc-gem-cat.csv]

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: Statements are supported by cited sources with reasonable inferences. The ResearchGate link confirms active community discussion: "Declutering the Earthquake Catalogue" represents ongoing methodological inquiries. The USGS eq-convert-catalog repository existence is confirmed by the GitHub links showing "test/data/isc-gem-cat.csv" and "test/iscgem_test.py", demonstrating USGS work on ISC-GEM conversion. The characterization as "institutional efforts to integrate historical ISC data" is accurate given ISC-GEM's documented integration into ComCat (KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md). The statement about "no equivalent open-source tool" for modern catalog matching is based on negative evidence (absence in search results) and represents a reasonable inference, though absolute claims about non-existence have inherent uncertainty. The WebSearch did not reveal any such tool despite specific searches for catalog matching and ObsPy duplicate detection. Confidence is MEDIUM due to the negative evidence nature of the final claim.]

## ISC Automated Event Association

Understanding how ISC itself groups origins from different agencies provides insight into professional approaches to the same-event problem.

### ISC Grouping Algorithm

The ISC employs an automated algorithm that scores hypocenters using multiple quality metrics, compares location and origin time parameters, and groups, splits, or creates new events based on hypocenter scores and parameter comparison. [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md] This algorithm determines when different agency reports represent the same physical earthquake versus distinct events, effectively solving the duplicate detection problem as part of ISC's data integration workflow. [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md] ISC analysts subsequently review the automated groupings using the Visual Bulletin Analysis System (VBAS) to verify that hypocenter grouping and phase arrival associations are appropriate. [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md] The review process explicitly checks for "split events," instances where severely mis-located hypocenter solutions from contributing agencies led to the formation of two separate events in the bulletin when only one physical event occurred. [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md]

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All statements are directly supported by KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md documentation. Lines 157-159 state: "Automatic algorithm that scores hypocentres using multiple quality metrics, compares location and origin time parameters, and groups, splits, or creates new events based on the hypocentre score and parameter comparison." Lines 160-164 document the review process: "Analysts review groupings to check that the grouping of hypocentres and association of phase arrivals is appropriate" with tool "Visual Bulletin Analysis System (VBAS)". Lines 166-168 define split events: "Split events are instances where one of the agencies reporting a severely mis-located hypocentre solution led to the formation of two separate events in the original ISC Bulletin, where in fact, there was just one physical event" citing Storchak et al. 2020. The characterization of this as solving the duplicate detection problem is a valid inference from the described functionality.]

### Multiple Origins and Author Attribution

When ISC successfully groups origins, the resulting event contains multiple origin blocks, each tagged with an `AUTHOR` field identifying the contributing organization. [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md] Querying the ISC FDSN web service with the `contributor=NEIC` parameter returns events where NEIC contributed data and automatically sets `includeallorigins=true`, providing all agency solutions rather than just the prime origin. [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md] This architecture allows users to examine all agency determinations for a single physical event, including both ISC's reviewed solution and the original NEIC (USGS) hypocenter. [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md] However, the original NEIC report appears as a secondary origin within the ISC event structure without preserving the USGS ComCat event ID; only the agency name (NEIC) and parametric data are retained. [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md][KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md]

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All statements are supported by KB documentation. KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md lines 85-95 document: "Each origin block contains AUTHOR field identifying the contributing organization (e.g., NEIC, ISC, JMA)" and "Using contributor parameter automatically sets includeallorigins to true" (line 105). Line 96 provides example: "contributor=NEIC returns events where NEIC contributed data, including all origins." The multiple origins structure is documented at lines 148-149: "Different agencies' solutions for the same event appear as separate origin blocks within a single ISC bulletin event." The characterization that this allows examination of "all agency determinations for a single physical event" follows directly from the documented functionality. The statement about NEIC reports appearing without USGS ComCat event IDs is supported by KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md lines 73-77 documenting absence of "Storage of original USGS event IDs in ISC Bulletin" and "Preservation of network-specific identifiers."]

### ISC Rebuild Project Lessons

The ISC Rebuild Project (Storchak et al. 2020) systematically reprocessed historical bulletin data and documented numerous cases of incorrectly grouped events. [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md] Examples include a Turkish observatory's event incorrectly cross-matched with a NEIC report due to data corruption, where identical P and S arrival times revealed the error. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md] Such cases demonstrate that even with sophisticated algorithms and comprehensive parametric data, automated event association can fail, requiring expert review and correction. [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md][KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md] The project's findings underscore the complexity of reliably matching earthquake events and the dangers of naive approaches that could merge distinct earthquakes based solely on spatiotemporal proximity. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md]

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All statements are supported by KB documentation with appropriate citations. KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md lines 166-168 reference "ISC Rebuild Paper (Storchak et al. 2020)" describing split events. KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md lines 107-115 provide the specific example: "From ISC Review Paper (Storchak et al. 2020): 'Data from reporting agencies arrived...they were integrated, re-assessed, reviewed and published.' 'One of the agencies reporting a severely mis-located hypocentre solution...led to the formation of two separate events in the original ISC Bulletin, where in fact, there was just one physical event.' Example from paper: 'A Turkish observatory's event was incorrectly cross-matched with a NEIC report, with identical P and S arrival times suggesting data corruption.'" The conclusion about complexity and dangers of naive approaches is a valid inference from these documented cases of automated system failures requiring expert correction.]

## Recommendations for Matching USGS and ISC Events

### Primary Strategy: Spatiotemporal Matching with Conservative Thresholds

The most reliable approach to matching USGS ComCat events with ISC Bulletin events involves spatiotemporal proximity matching with deliberately conservative thresholds to minimize false positives. [WEB:https://frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2022.820277/full] Based on peer-reviewed literature, a reasonable starting point uses maximum spatial separation of 50-100 km, maximum temporal difference of 60-120 seconds, and maximum magnitude difference of 0.3-0.5 units. [WEB:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0234-z][WEB:https://frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2022.820277/full] These thresholds should be adjusted based on regional seismicity characteristics, network density, and location accuracy; areas with dense seismic networks and well-constrained hypocenters can use tighter thresholds, while regions with sparse instrumentation require more generous windows. [WEB:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0234-z]

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: The recommendation is supported by cited sources but involves some synthesis and expert judgment. The WEB citation to the Frontiers article confirmed spatiotemporal matching methods and noted traditional thresholds "on the order of 100 km in distance" and "1 minute in time." The WEB citation to Nature article stated "60 s" time and "difference of less than 1°" (approximately 111 km) and "M± 0.5" magnitude thresholds. The recommended ranges (50-100 km, 60-120 seconds, 0.3-0.5 magnitude units) fall within or slightly more conservative than published values. The statement about adjusting thresholds based on regional characteristics and network density represents standard seismological practice and is implied by the Nature article's context of creating region-specific unified catalogs. The characterization as "conservative" to "minimize false positives" aligns with the Frontiers article's critique of overly generous windows. Confidence is MEDIUM because the specific range recommendations synthesize multiple sources rather than quoting single authoritative values.]

### Critical Consideration: Aftershock and Swarm Exclusion

Any matching algorithm must explicitly account for aftershock sequences and earthquake swarms where numerous distinct events occur in close spatiotemporal proximity. [WEB:https://frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2022.820277/full] The failure mode described in the task specification ("events within 50km and 60 seconds must be the same") would catastrophically merge mainshocks with their aftershocks, essentially destroying the scientific value of the merged catalog. [WEB:https://frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2022.820277/full] Proper approaches implement nearest-neighbor matching rather than window-based matching, ensuring each event in catalog A matches at most one event in catalog B. [WEB:https://frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2022.820277/full] Additional safeguards include examining the full spatiotemporal context (are there dozens of events nearby?), checking magnitude consistency across matched events, and flagging potential matches in known aftershock sequences for manual expert review. [WEB:https://frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2022.820277/full][WEB:https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/224/2/1174/5911581]

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All statements are supported by cited sources and logical inference from task requirements. The Frontiers article WebFetch explicitly stated that simple thresholds are "inadequate, especially for dense aftershock sequences" where "many distinct earthquakes occur in close proximity." The user's task specification described a previous failed attempt with "arbitrary thresholds ('events within 50km and 60 seconds must be the same') that would have destroyed the database by merging thousands of different earthquakes." The characterization that this would merge mainshocks with aftershocks and destroy catalog value is a valid inference from this documented failure. The Frontiers article confirmed nearest-neighbor approaches: "two-step process that: 1. Finds nearest neighbors between catalogs, 2. Resolves cases where multiple events map to the same neighbor" ensuring one-to-one matching. The safeguards mentioned (spatiotemporal context, magnitude consistency, manual review) represent synthesis of best practices from the cited sources and standard seismological methodology. The statement is well-supported though involves some expert synthesis.]

### Implementation Workflow

A practical implementation workflow involves the following steps: (1) Query USGS ComCat for events in the region and time period of interest using the FDSN web service with appropriate magnitude, location, and temporal filters. [KB:01_usgs_comcat_api.md] (2) Query ISC Bulletin using equivalent search parameters; note that ISC reviewed data is typically available 24 months after event occurrence. [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md] (3) For each ISC event, compute distances and time differences to all USGS events, identifying the nearest neighbor. [WEB:https://frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2022.820277/full] (4) Filter candidate matches using threshold criteria (distance, time, magnitude difference). [WEB:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0234-z] (5) Resolve ambiguous cases where multiple USGS events match a single ISC event or vice versa, typically by selecting the closest match and flagging others for manual review. [WEB:https://frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2022.820277/full] (6) Validate results by examining events in known aftershock sequences and checking for implausible magnitude or location discrepancies. [WEB:https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/224/2/1174/5911581]

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The workflow synthesizes documented capabilities and best practices from cited sources. Step 1 is supported by KB:01_usgs_comcat_api.md which documents the FDSN web service query parameters including magnitude, location, and temporal filters (lines 45-75). Step 2 is supported by KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md documenting equivalent ISC query parameters (lines 66-106) and the 24-month review lag (line 11). Step 3 (nearest neighbor computation) is directly from the Frontiers article which described "Finds nearest neighbors between catalogs" as the first step. Step 4 (threshold filtering) is from the Nature article which described using time, distance, and magnitude thresholds to identify potential duplicates. Step 5 (resolving ambiguities) is from the Frontiers article: "Resolves cases where multiple events map to the same neighbor." Step 6 (validation) synthesizes the Frontiers article's concern about aftershock sequences and standard quality control practices. The workflow is logical, well-supported, and implementable using documented APIs and methods.]

### Special Cases and Exceptions

For earthquakes included in the ISC-GEM historical catalog (1900-2014), direct ID linkage exists via the `iscgem` entries in USGS ComCat's `ids` field. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md][WEB:https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/comcat/catalog/iscgem/] Users working with historical earthquakes should first check for ISC-GEM identifiers before implementing spatiotemporal matching. [WEB:https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/comcat/catalog/iscgem/] For events outside ISC-GEM coverage (primarily post-2014), spatiotemporal matching remains necessary. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md] Users should also note that USGS preferred event IDs can change over time as new analyses become available; the `ids` field provides historical tracking of identifier evolution. [KB:01_usgs_comcat_api.md] When ISC reprocesses events during their review cycle, origin time and location may shift slightly from initial NEIC determinations, potentially affecting threshold-based matching; magnitude comparisons should use consistent magnitude types (e.g., Mw) when available. [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md]

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All statements are directly supported by KB documentation and cited sources. KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md lines 118-125 document ISC-GEM catalog integration with coverage 1900-2010 (later extended to 2014 per WEB citation). The Tohoku earthquake example demonstrated the iscgem identifier in the ids field (verified by WEB citation). The recommendation to check ISC-GEM identifiers first for historical earthquakes is a logical best practice given the documented direct linkage. The statement about post-2014 events is supported by KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md line 125: "No documentation found describing integration of modern ISC Bulletin event IDs into ComCat." KB:01_usgs_comcat_api.md line 17 states: "This is the current preferred id for the event, and may change over time." Lines 25-27 describe the ids field as tracking associated identifiers. KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md documents ISC review process and multiple magnitude determinations, supporting the statement about potential parameter shifts during review. All claims are precisely supported.]

## Conclusion

No official cross-reference mechanism exists for linking USGS ComCat event IDs with ISC Bulletin event IDs, with the exception of historical events covered by the ISC-GEM catalog (1900-2014). [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md][WEB:https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/comcat/catalog/iscgem/] Earthquake catalog deduplication across these two fundamental global datasets requires spatiotemporal proximity matching using methods documented in peer-reviewed seismological literature. [WEB:https://frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2022.820277/full][WEB:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0234-z] Conservative distance (50-100 km), time (60-120 seconds), and magnitude (0.3-0.5 units) thresholds combined with nearest-neighbor matching algorithms provide the most reliable approach while avoiding catastrophic false positives that would merge mainshocks with aftershocks. [WEB:https://frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2022.820277/full][WEB:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0234-z] Understanding that seismologists at ISC solve this same problem during their data integration workflow—using automated algorithms, quality metrics, and expert review—provides confidence that the challenge, while complex, is solvable with appropriate methodological rigor. [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md]

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This conclusion accurately synthesizes all findings from the document. The absence of cross-reference mechanism except for ISC-GEM is documented in KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md lines 198-204 and confirmed by WEB citation. The requirement for spatiotemporal proximity matching is established by the Frontiers and Nature article citations. The specific threshold ranges (50-100 km, 60-120 seconds, 0.3-0.5 magnitude) represent the synthesis of published values from the cited papers (100 km and 1 minute traditional thresholds from Frontiers, 1 degree and 60 seconds from Nature). The nearest-neighbor approach to avoid false positives is directly from the Frontiers article. The statement about ISC's workflow solving the same problem is supported by KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md documentation of ISC's automated grouping algorithm, quality metrics, and expert review process (lines 157-164). The conclusion integrates all major findings coherently and is fully supported by cited evidence.]
