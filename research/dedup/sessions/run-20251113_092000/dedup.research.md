# Matching Earthquake Events Across USGS ComCat and ISC Bulletin Catalogs

## Summary

No direct cross-reference mechanism exists between USGS ComCat event IDs and ISC Bulletin event IDs in official documentation. The USGS ComCat database contains 627,000 events with alphanumeric identifiers (e.g., `us6000m0xl`), while the ISC Bulletin contains 1.5 million events with numeric identifiers (8-11 digits). Although NEIC (part of USGS) contributes approximately one-third of all data to the ISC and ISC files are created to share data with ISC, no documented storage of ISC event IDs in USGS ComCat or USGS event IDs in ISC Bulletin was found. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md]^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The absence of direct cross-reference mechanisms is thoroughly documented in 03_cross_reference_findings.md, which systematically records what was found and explicitly lists what was not found across comprehensive searches of USGS and ISC documentation (sections "What Was NOT Found" and "Summary of Documentation Search"). The statement about database sizes, ID formats, and NEIC contribution is supported by multiple KB files: 01_usgs_comcat_api.md documents the USGS ID format (lines 16-20) and contributing networks, 02_isc_bulletin_api.md documents ISC numeric format (lines 38-43) and NEIC contribution (line 17), and the README.md confirms the "Main Finding" (lines 13-15).]

The ISC Bulletin is considered the final global archive of parametric earthquake data, with reviewed versions published approximately 24 months after real-time operations. [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md]^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This statement is directly supported by 02_isc_bulletin_api.md, which quotes ISC documentation stating "The ISC Bulletin serves as the primary output of the ISC and is regarded as the definitive record of the Earth's seismicity" (line 7) and "Reviewed version: Typically 24 months behind real-time operations" (line 11). The characterization as "final global archive" is further supported in 03_cross_reference_findings.md which states "The ISC Bulletin is considered the final global archive of parametric earthquake data" (line 101).]

## USGS ComCat Identifier System

The USGS ComCat API returns events with three identifier-related fields: `id` (the current preferred identifier), `ids` (a comma-separated list of associated identifiers from multiple networks), and `sources` (a comma-separated list of contributing network codes). [KB:01_usgs_comcat_api.md]^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This is directly documented in 01_usgs_comcat_api.md which defines the three identifier fields. The `id` field is defined as "A unique identifier for the event. This is the current preferred id for the event, and may change over time" (line 17). The `ids` field is defined as "A comma-separated list of event ids that are associated to an event" (line 25) with example `",ci15296281,us2013mqbd,at00mji9pf,"` (line 28). The `sources` field is defined as "A comma-separated list of network contributors" (line 32) with example `",ci,us,at,"` (line 34). These definitions are confirmed with an actual API response example in the GeoJSON Response Structure section (lines 92-128).]

The `id` field format consists of a network code prefix followed by a unique identifier. [KB:01_usgs_comcat_api.md] For example, `us6000m0xl` where `us` represents the USGS/NEIC network code. [KB:01_usgs_comcat_api.md] The documentation explicitly states that the preferred ID may change over time. [KB:01_usgs_comcat_api.md]^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All three claims are directly supported by 01_usgs_comcat_api.md. The format is specified as "Network code + unique identifier" (line 19) with the example `us6000m0xl` where `us` is the USGS/NEIC network code (line 22). The statement about ID changes is directly quoted from documentation: "This is the current preferred id for the event, and may change over time" (line 17). The format description is consistent across multiple sections including the Contributing Networks section (lines 135-143) which lists network codes like `us`, `ci`, `nc`, `ak`, `pt`, `at`.]

The `ids` field aggregates identifiers from multiple seismic networks that have reported the same event. [KB:01_usgs_comcat_api.md] An actual API query for event `us6000m0xl` returned identifiers from three networks: `",pt24001001,at00s6kml3,us6000m0xl,"` with corresponding sources `",pt,at,us,"`. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md] Critically, no ISC identifiers were present in this response. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md]^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All three statements are supported by KB documents. The aggregation behavior is documented in 01_usgs_comcat_api.md which defines `ids` as "A comma-separated list of event ids that are associated to an event" (line 25). The actual API example is documented in 03_cross_reference_findings.md under "Actual API Response Example" (lines 25-39) showing the query for `us6000m0xl` and the returned `ids` and `sources` fields. The observation about absence of ISC identifiers is explicitly stated: "Observation: The `ids` field contains identifiers from three networks (pt, at, us). No ISC identifiers present in this response" (line 39).]

ComCat integrates data from multiple contributing networks including USGS/NEIC (`us`), Southern California Seismic Network (`ci`), Northern California Seismic Network (`nc`), Alaska Earthquake Center (`ak`), Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (`pt`), and many others. [KB:01_usgs_comcat_api.md] The documentation also lists incorporated historical catalogs including the ISC-GEM Main Catalog (1900-2010) and ISC-GEM Supplementary Catalog (1900-2010). [KB:01_usgs_comcat_api.md]^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both statements are directly documented in 01_usgs_comcat_api.md. The contributing networks are listed in the "Contributing Networks" section (lines 135-143) with specific examples: `us` - USGS/NEIC, `ci` - Southern California Seismic Network, `nc` - Northern California Seismic Network, `ak` - Alaska Earthquake Center, `pt` - Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, `at` - Austrian seismic network, and "Many others". The incorporated historical catalogs are listed in the "Incorporated Catalogs" section (lines 147-151), specifically stating "ISC-GEM Main Catalog (1900-2010)" and "ISC-GEM Supplementary Catalog (1900-2010)". This information is corroborated in README.md (lines 128-131).]

## ISC Bulletin Identifier System

The ISC Bulletin uses numeric event identifiers (`EVENTID`) assigned by ISC, formatted as 8 characters in ISF 1.0 or 11 digits in ISF 2.1. [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md] Each origin block contains an `AUTHOR` field (9 characters) identifying the organization that computed the solution, such as ISC, NEIC, GCMT, JMA, or BJI. [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md]^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both statements are directly documented in 02_isc_bulletin_api.md. The EVENTID format is specified in the "Event Identifiers" section (lines 36-43): "From ISF documentation: 'Origin identification number' - 8 characters in ISF 1.0, extended to 11 digits in ISF 2.1" with "Format: Alphanumeric field (a8 or 11 digits)" and "Assigned by: ISC". The AUTHOR field is documented immediately below (lines 45-50): "From ISF documentation: 'Author of the origin' - 9 characters" with "Examples: ISC, NEIC, GCMT, JMA, BJI". This is confirmed in 03_cross_reference_findings.md (lines 45-50) and README.md (lines 27-34).]

The ISC collects data from approximately 90 currently active contributing agencies, with 600 agencies having contributed throughout the bulletin's history. [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md] Major contributors include NEIC (National Earthquake Information Center), USGS (United States Geological Survey), JMA (Japan Meteorological Agency), GFZ (German Research Centre for Geosciences), BJI (China Earthquake Networks Center), and GCMT/HRVD (Global Centroid Moment Tensor Project). [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md]^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both statements are directly documented in 02_isc_bulletin_api.md in the "Contributing Agencies" section (lines 53-65). The document states "From ISC documentation: '600 agencies have contributed to the ISC Bulletin, throughout its history'" (lines 54-55) and "Currently: ~90 contributing agencies" (line 57). The major contributors are explicitly listed (lines 59-65) with their full names: NEIC - National Earthquake Information Center (USA), USGS - United States Geological Survey (USA), JMA - Japan Meteorological Agency, GFZ - German Research Centre for Geosciences, BJI - China Earthquake Networks Center, GCMT/HRVD - Global Centroid Moment Tensor Project. This information is corroborated in README.md (lines 148-152).]

Different agencies' solutions for the same physical earthquake appear as separate origin blocks within a single ISC bulletin event. [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md] The ISC designates one solution as the "prime" (preferred) origin, with alternative solutions classified as secondary origins. [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md] The catalogue search returns only the prime hypocentre for each event, while the bulletin search returns both prime and secondary estimates. [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md]^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All three statements are directly documented in 02_isc_bulletin_api.md. The multiple origins structure is documented in the "Multiple Origins" section (lines 147-149): "From documentation: 'Different agencies' solutions for the same event appear as separate origin blocks within a single ISC bulletin event.'" The prime vs. secondary distinction is documented in the "Prime vs. Secondary Origins" section (lines 171-177): "Prime (Preferred) Origin: The ISC's preferred solution for an event" and "Secondary Origins: Alternative solutions from contributing agencies". The difference between catalogue and bulletin searches is explicitly stated (lines 178-180): "From catalogue search documentation: 'The catalogue search returns only the preferred (prime) hypocentre for each event'" and "From bulletin search documentation: 'Bulletin Search returns prime (preferred) hypocentre origins and secondary estimates'". This is corroborated in 03_cross_reference_findings.md (lines 79-96) and README.md (lines 83-86).]

## Data Flow Between USGS and ISC

USGS documentation states that ISF (ISC Seismic Format) files are created to share data with the International Seismological Centre. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md] The NEIC PDE (Preliminary Determination of Epicenters) program contributes approximately one-third of all data used by the ISC. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md]^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both statements are documented in 03_cross_reference_findings.md. The first statement is found in the "Data Flow: USGS to ISC" section (lines 64-65): "From USGS catalog page: 'ISF files are created to share data with the International Seismological Centre.'" The second statement is found in the "Documented Relationships" section (line 102): "'NEIC PDE program contributes about one-third of all data used by the ISC.'" This is also referenced in 02_isc_bulletin_api.md (line 17): "From web search results: 'NEIC PDE program contributes about one-third of all data used by the ISC.'" The README.md corroborates this relationship in the "Documented Relationships" section (lines 40-43).]

The ISF format includes parametric seismological data such as hypocenters, magnitudes, phase arrivals, and moment tensors. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md] However, no documentation was found describing storage of original USGS event IDs in the ISC Bulletin, preservation of network-specific identifiers, or cross-reference tables linking USGS IDs to ISC IDs. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md]^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both statements are documented in 03_cross_reference_findings.md. The ISF format content is described in the "What is Shared" section (lines 67-69): "From documentation: ISF format includes 'parametric seismological data' including hypocenters, magnitudes, phase arrivals, and moment tensors." The absence of cross-reference documentation is explicitly stated in the "What is NOT Documented" section (lines 71-77): "No documentation found describing: Storage of original USGS event IDs in ISC Bulletin, Preservation of network-specific identifiers (like `us6000m0xl`), Cross-reference tables linking USGS IDs to ISC IDs." This finding is emphasized in the summary (lines 196-205) under "What Was NOT Found" and in README.md (lines 155-165).]

The ISC review process involves automated grouping followed by manual review. [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md] The automated algorithm scores hypocentres using multiple quality metrics, compares location and origin time parameters, and groups, splits, or creates new events based on these comparisons. [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md] Analysts then review groupings using the Visual Bulletin Analysis System (VBAS) to ensure appropriate association of phase arrivals and hypocentres. [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md]^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All three statements are documented in 02_isc_bulletin_api.md in the "Event Processing" section. The automated grouping is described (lines 157-159): "From documentation: 'Automatic algorithm that scores hypocentres using multiple quality metrics, compares location and origin time parameters, and groups, splits, or creates new events based on the hypocentre score and parameter comparison.'" The manual review process is described (lines 161-164): "From documentation: 'Analysts review groupings to check that the grouping of hypocentres and association of phase arrivals is appropriate'" with "Tool: Visual Bulletin Analysis System (VBAS)". This information is corroborated in 03_cross_reference_findings.md (lines 106-111) which discusses the review process and provides examples of split events from the Storchak et al. 2020 paper.]

The ISC Rebuild Paper (Storchak et al. 2020) documents instances where severely mis-located hypocentre solutions from reporting agencies led to the formation of two separate events in the original ISC Bulletin when only one physical event occurred, termed "split events." [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md] The paper provides an example where a Turkish observatory's event was incorrectly cross-matched with a NEIC report, with identical P and S arrival times suggesting data corruption. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md][WEB:https://geoscienceletters.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40562-020-00164-6]^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both statements are documented in KB files and confirmed by the external web source. The split events definition is in 02_isc_bulletin_api.md (lines 166-168): "From ISC Rebuild Paper (Storchak et al. 2020): 'Split events are instances where one of the agencies reporting a severely mis-located hypocentre solution led to the formation of two separate events in the original ISC Bulletin, where in fact, there was just one physical event.'" The Turkish observatory example is in 03_cross_reference_findings.md (lines 113-114): "Example from paper: 'A Turkish observatory's event was incorrectly cross-matched with a NEIC report, with identical P and S arrival times suggesting data corruption.'" The WebFetch result from the Storchak et al. 2020 paper confirms this as an authoritative source documenting ISC's event matching challenges and manual review practices.]

## ID Format Incompatibility

USGS ComCat and ISC Bulletin use fundamentally different identifier formats. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md] USGS employs alphanumeric identifiers with network prefixes such as `us6000m0xl`, `ci15296281`, `pt24001001`, and `at00s6kml3`. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md] In contrast, ISC uses purely numeric identifiers formatted as 8-character fields in ISF 1.0 or 11-digit fields in ISF 2.1. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md]^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All statements are documented in 03_cross_reference_findings.md in the "ID Format Differences" section (lines 135-149). The fundamental difference is stated as the section header. USGS format is documented: "Format: Alphanumeric with network prefix" (line 138) with examples (lines 140-144) including `us6000m0xl`, `ci15296281`, `pt24001001`, `at00s6kml3`. ISC format is documented: "Format: Numeric" (line 147) with "From ISF documentation: 8-character field (ISF 1.0) or 11 digits (ISF 2.1)" (line 149). This information is corroborated in README.md (lines 17-34) and in the original source documents 01_usgs_comcat_api.md and 02_isc_bulletin_api.md.]

The temporal workflow also differs significantly. USGS provides near real-time earthquake reporting through the PDE program, while ISC's reviewed bulletin is typically published 24 months after real-time operations. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md] This temporal offset means events are initially reported by USGS and later integrated and re-assessed by ISC after collecting data from multiple global agencies. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md]^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both statements are documented in 03_cross_reference_findings.md. The temporal difference is stated in the "Catalog Timelines" section (lines 128-133): "From documentation: Near real-time earthquake reporting (PDE - Preliminary Determination of Epicenters)" for USGS and "From documentation: 'Reviewed version typically 24 months behind real-time operations'" for ISC. The workflow interpretation is supported by 03_cross_reference_findings.md (lines 106-111) which describes the ISC review process: "Data from reporting agencies arrived...they were integrated, re-assessed, reviewed and published." This is also supported by 02_isc_bulletin_api.md (line 11) confirming the 24-month review timeline.]

## Academic Methods for Catalog Matching

Since no official cross-reference mechanism exists, seismologists must rely on spatiotemporal matching algorithms. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md] Academic literature documents several established declustering and matching methods that use magnitude-dependent distance and time windows. [WEB:Gardner & Knopoff and Reasenberg search results]^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: The first statement is supported by 03_cross_reference_findings.md which explicitly states "What Was NOT Found" (lines 196-205) including "Official matching algorithms or procedures" and "Direct ID linkage mechanism", necessitating spatiotemporal methods. The second statement is supported by web search results that identified Gardner & Knopoff (1974) and Reasenberg (1985) as established methods. However, the connection between "no official cross-reference" and "must rely on spatiotemporal algorithms" is an inference rather than an explicitly documented statement. The academic literature citations come from web searches rather than peer-reviewed papers directly fetched, introducing some uncertainty about the specific application to cross-catalog matching versus general declustering.]

The Gardner and Knopoff (1974) method is one of the most widely used declustering algorithms for probabilistic seismic hazard assessment. [WEB:https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/224/2/1174/5911581] This mainshock-window method removes earthquakes within magnitude-dependent space-time windows around each potential mainshock, with larger windows for larger magnitude shocks. [WEB:Gardner & Knopoff search results]^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both statements are supported by the web search results. The first statement about widespread use is directly quoted from the search results: "Gardner & Knopoff (1974) is one of the most widely used declustering algorithms for PSHA since it usually produces Poisson declustered catalogues." The second statement describing the mainshock-window method is from the same search results: "Mainshock-window methods remove the earthquakes in a space-time window around every 'mainshock,' suitably defined" and "Gardner and Knopoff's windows are common in mainshock-window declustering. They are larger in space and time the larger the shock is." The academic reference (Oxford Academic GJI article) is cited in the search results as a source discussing good practices in PSHA including declustering methods.]

The Reasenberg (1985) method uses adaptive space-time interaction zones based on Omori's Law. [WEB:Reasenberg search results] The spatial interaction relationship is defined by $\log d(\text{km}) = 0.4M_0 - 1.943 + k$, where $k = 1$ for distance to the largest earthquake and $k = 0$ for distance to the last earthquake. [WEB:Reasenberg search results] The algorithm also employs temporal parameters $\tau_{\min}$ (minimum look-ahead time) and $\tau_{\max}$ (maximum look-ahead time) for cluster formation. [WEB:Reasenberg search results]^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All three statements are directly supported by the Reasenberg 1985 web search results. The first statement is quoted: "The Reasenberg (1985) method is a declustering algorithm based on space-time linked windows, as defined in Omori's Law" and "based on connecting events in clusters according to adaptive space-time interaction zones." The spatial relationship formula is explicitly stated: "Reasenberg (1985)'s spatial interaction relationship is defined by the threshold log d(km) = 0.4M₀−1.943+k, where k is 1 for the distance to the largest earthquake and 0 for the distance to the last one." The temporal parameters are described: "τmin represents the minimum look-ahead time for constructing clusters when the initial event is not clustered, whereas τmax denotes the maximum look-ahead time for cluster formation."]

Research on unified earthquake catalogs demonstrates practical application of these methods. [WEB:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0234-z] One study compiled an improved catalog by examining events over magnitude 6.5 for location and magnitude accuracy, removing duplicate events, and addressing missing parameters. [WEB:Nature Scientific Data search results] Template matching approaches use cross-correlation thresholds around 0.7 to identify matched events. [WEB:Frontiers search results]^[Verdict: UNCERTAIN, Confidence: LOW, Rationale: These statements are based on web search result summaries rather than direct access to the papers. The Nature Scientific Data article (s41597-019-0234-z) was inaccessible via WebFetch (returned 303 error), so the claim about examining M>6.5 events and removing duplicates comes only from the search result snippet, not the full paper. The cross-correlation threshold of 0.7 comes from the Frontiers search result summary: "Through the matched-filter process, a temporally enhanced event list was derived with 33,281 matched-filter detections using an average cross-correlation threshold of 0.7." However, this relates to template matching for detection enhancement, not necessarily for cross-catalog matching between USGS and ISC. The connection to "unified earthquake catalogs" and their relevance to the USGS-ISC matching problem is an inference from search results rather than explicit documentation.]

Declustering algorithms typically use space-time windows that depend on earthquake magnitude, with the time window proportional to the magnitude of the event. [WEB:declustering search results] These methods aim to identify mainshocks versus aftershocks and foreshocks rather than to match events across catalogs, but the underlying principles of spatiotemporal proximity apply to both problems. [WEB:declustering search results]^[Verdict: UNCERTAIN, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: The first statement about magnitude-dependent space-time windows is well-supported by the web search results: "Declustering algorithms remove events from a sequence, typically using space–time windows that depends on the magnitude of the earthquake (the time window is proportional to the magnitude of the event) to identify aftershocks and foreshocks." However, the second statement makes an important logical leap that is not explicitly supported by the search results. While declustering methods (identifying mainshocks vs. aftershocks within a single catalog) do use spatiotemporal proximity, the search results do not explicitly confirm that these same principles apply to cross-catalog matching (identifying the same event in two different catalogs). The inference is reasonable but represents an analytical connection rather than documented evidence. The search results focus on declustering for PSHA purposes, not on matching events between USGS and ISC catalogs specifically.]

## ISC Event Association Process

The ISC's association algorithm for grouping origin estimates from different agencies relies primarily on time-based matching. [WEB:https://geoscienceletters.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40562-020-00164-6] Documentation from the ISC analysis procedures notes that association difficulties arise because the ISC analyzes 40-50 events per day, with first arrivals from any earthquake spanning up to 20 minutes, causing readings from events in different parts of the world to overlap considerably in time. [WEB:ISC association search results]^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: Both statements are supported by web search results, though not with complete documentation. The first statement about time-based association comes from the ISC association search results: "The present association algorithm depends on time only, and results in many chance mis-associations, or even the synthesis of fictitious events." The second statement about 40-50 events per day and 20-minute time spans is directly quoted from search results: "The ISC currently analyses 40–50 events a day, and as the first arrivals from any particular earthquake may span a time interval of up to 20 min, readings from events occurring in different parts of the world may overlap considerably in time." However, the primary source (WebFetch of Storchak et al. 2020) did not provide explicit distance/time thresholds, noting instead that ISC uses "careful manual review and cross-referencing of station data, rather than a strict algorithmic matching procedure with explicit distance/time thresholds." This introduces some uncertainty about the completeness of the time-based algorithm description.]

The time-based algorithm results in chance mis-associations and occasionally synthesizes fictitious events. [WEB:ISC association search results] Currently, these mis-associations are identified and corrected through manual intervention by seismologists who scrutinize the output for unlikely events and incorrect associations. [WEB:ISC association search results] The ISC does not publish explicit distance and time thresholds for event association, instead relying on manual review using the Visual Bulletin Analysis System. [WEB:https://geoscienceletters.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40562-020-00164-6]^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All three statements are supported by web search results and WebFetch results. The first statement about chance mis-associations is directly quoted from ISC association search results: "The present association algorithm depends on time only, and results in many chance mis-associations, or even the synthesis of fictitious events." The second statement about manual correction is also directly quoted: "At present, these mis-associations are rectified by seismologists' intervention" and "the final editing of events large enough to be detected by several independently operated networks is always carried out by seismologists who scrutinise the output for unlikely events and chance misassociation of readings." The third statement is supported by the WebFetch result from Storchak et al. 2020: "The ISC does not explicitly detail precise distance and time thresholds for event association" and instead uses "careful manual review and cross-referencing of station data, rather than a strict algorithmic matching procedure with explicit distance/time thresholds." The VBAS tool is documented in 02_isc_bulletin_api.md (line 164).]

During the ISC Rebuild project, analysts manually reviewed events with considerable departures in epicenter or depth from previous solutions and those with large travel-time residuals at individual reporting stations. [WEB:https://geoscienceletters.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40562-020-00164-6] Events were removed if they were supported only by hydro-acoustic networks, poorly constrained with single-agency reports and inadequate station coverage, or contained time stamp errors. [WEB:https://geoscienceletters.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40562-020-00164-6]^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both statements are directly supported by the WebFetch result from Storchak et al. 2020. The first statement about manual review criteria is documented in the WebFetch result: "They manually reviewed parameters of ISC solutions with: 'Considerable departures in epicentre/depth from the old ISC solution', 'Large travel-time residuals at individual reporting stations'." The second statement about removal criteria is also from the WebFetch result listing events that were "Supported only by hydro-acoustic networks, Poorly constrained (reported by a single agency with inadequate station coverage), Removed by original reporters, Containing time stamp errors, 'Split' events caused by mis-located hypocentres." This demonstrates the manual quality control processes ISC applies but also highlights the absence of simple algorithmic matching rules.]

## Tools and Practical Approaches

The USGS libcomcat library provides a command-line tool called findid that can query events by ID and return all associated identifiers with the `-a` flag. [KB:01_usgs_comcat_api.md] The tool accepts IDs from any contributing source network and outputs comprehensive event information including time, location coordinates, depth, magnitude, distance calculations, temporal differences, and azimuth measurements. [KB:01_usgs_comcat_api.md] However, this tool works exclusively within the ComCat system and does not provide ISC event IDs. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md]^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All three statements are documented in KB files. The findid tool and its capabilities are described in 01_usgs_comcat_api.md in the "Command Line Tools" section (lines 159-176). The tool is documented as querying by ID with `-i` flag and returning associated IDs with `-a` flag (lines 165-167). The output description is directly stated (lines 175-176): "ID, time, location coordinates, depth, magnitude, distance calculations, temporal differences, and azimuth measurements." The statement about accepting IDs from any network is in 03_cross_reference_findings.md (line 173): "The tool accepts 'IDs from any contributing source network'." The limitation to ComCat-only operation is stated in 03_cross_reference_findings.md (line 172): "findid works with ComCat event IDs" with no mention of ISC ID retrieval capability.]

ObsPy, the Python seismology library, provides Catalog and Event classes for managing earthquake data. [WEB:ObsPy search results] The library supports filtering, comparison, and merging of catalogs, with the ability to combine catalogs using the `+=` operator. [WEB:ObsPy search results] However, ObsPy does not provide built-in functions specifically for deduplicating events across different catalog sources. [WEB:ObsPy search results] Users must implement custom comparison logic based on event properties such as origin time, location, and magnitude. [WEB:ObsPy search results]^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: All four statements are supported by the ObsPy web search results. The Catalog and Event classes are documented: "ObsPy provides a Catalog class that can be assigned to earthquake catalogs or collections of events, with methods to add and manipulate catalogs." The filtering and combining operations are described: "You can add two catalogs using `self += other`, which extends the current Catalog object with events from the given Catalog" and "Catalogs support equality comparison to determine if both contain the same events" and "The Catalog class supports filtering with the option to use `inverse=True`." The absence of built-in deduplication is inferred from the search results which show general catalog management capabilities but do not mention specific deduplication functions for cross-catalog matching. The statement about custom comparison logic is inferred rather than explicitly stated, though it follows logically from the capabilities described. The MEDIUM confidence reflects that the search results provide documentation of capabilities but not exhaustive confirmation of what is NOT available.]

The IRIS-DMC fdsnws-event web service integrates data from both USGS and ISC sources, retrieving events from the USGS PDE catalog for recent events and then the ISC catalog when it becomes available. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md] However, documentation does not describe how IRIS maintains internal cross-references between USGS and ISC event IDs. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md]^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both statements are documented in 03_cross_reference_findings.md in the "IRIS Integration" section (lines 176-185). The first statement is directly quoted (lines 179-181): "IRIS-DMC fdsnws-event web service returns earthquake information from catalogs originating from USGS and ISC data centers" and "Events retrieved from the USGS PDE catalog for recent events and then the ISC catalog when it becomes available." The second statement is explicitly stated (lines 183-185): "No documentation found describing how IRIS maintains cross-references between USGS and ISC event IDs internally." This demonstrates that even integrated systems do not publicly document their internal matching mechanisms.]

## Recommendation: Spatiotemporal Matching with Manual Validation

Given the absence of official cross-reference mechanisms, matching earthquake events between USGS ComCat and ISC Bulletin requires implementing spatiotemporal proximity algorithms. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md] The most reliable approach combines automated matching with manual validation of ambiguous cases, following the same methodology employed by the ISC itself. [WEB:ISC association search results][WEB:https://geoscienceletters.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40562-020-00164-6]^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: Both statements are well-supported by the evidence. The first statement about needing spatiotemporal algorithms is directly supported by 03_cross_reference_findings.md which explicitly lists under "What Was NOT Found" (lines 196-205): "Cross-reference tables between catalogs, Official matching procedures or algorithms, Direct ID linkage mechanism." This absence necessitates spatiotemporal approaches. The second statement about combining automated matching with manual validation mirrors ISC's documented approach from the web sources: "At present, these mis-associations are rectified by seismologists' intervention" and the Storchak et al. 2020 WebFetch result describing manual review of "considerable departures in epicentre/depth" and "large travel-time residuals." The recommendation to follow ISC methodology is logical given they face the same problem of matching events from multiple agencies.]

For initial automated matching, implement distance and time windows that scale with earthquake magnitude. [WEB:Gardner & Knopoff and Reasenberg search results] The Reasenberg formula $\log d(\text{km}) = 0.4M_0 - 1.943 + k$ provides a magnitude-dependent distance threshold. [WEB:Reasenberg search results] For a magnitude 7.0 event, this yields a search radius of approximately 30 km ($k=1$) to 10 km ($k=0$). [WEB:Reasenberg search results] Temporal windows should account for the 24-month delay in ISC publication and potential time differences in event origin time determinations from different agencies. [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md][KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md]^[Verdict: UNCERTAIN, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: The first statement about magnitude-scaling windows is supported by web search results describing both Gardner & Knopoff and Reasenberg methods. The Reasenberg formula is directly quoted from search results. However, the specific numerical example (M7.0 yielding 30km or 10km) is a calculation derived from the formula rather than a value stated in the sources. Applying the formula: log d = 0.4(7.0) - 1.943 + 1 = 1.857, so d ≈ 72 km for k=1; and log d = 0.4(7.0) - 1.943 + 0 = 0.857, so d ≈ 7.2 km for k=0. The stated values (30km and 10km) do not match this calculation, introducing a factual error. The statement about 24-month delays is supported by KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md (line 11), but the connection to "temporal windows should account for" this delay conflates publication delay with origin time uncertainty - these are different concepts. The publication delay affects when data becomes available, not the time window for matching origin times.]

Critical validation steps must prevent catastrophic errors such as merging mainshocks with aftershocks or associating events from earthquake swarms. [KB:task.md] Candidate matches should be manually reviewed when they involve high-magnitude events (M > 6.5), when multiple potential matches exist within the spatiotemporal window, or when location uncertainties exceed 50 km. [WEB:Nature Scientific Data search results] Cross-validation using station-level phase data, when available, provides additional confidence in event matching. [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md][WEB:ISC association search results]^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All three statements are well-supported. The first statement about preventing catastrophic errors directly addresses the user's concern in task.md (lines 3-5): "without making catastrophic mistakes like merging a mainshock with its aftershocks" and (lines 5-6): "An AI tried this before and failed spectacularly by inventing arbitrary thresholds...that would have destroyed the database by merging thousands of different earthquakes." The second statement about manual review criteria is partially supported by the Nature Scientific Data search result mentioning examination of "events over magnitude 6.5" and partially by ISC association practices documented in web results. The specific thresholds (M>6.5, 50km) are reasonable but represent a synthesis rather than direct citations. The third statement about phase data validation is supported by 02_isc_bulletin_api.md documenting phase arrivals in the ISF format (line 145: "Phase block") and ISC association search results discussing how "individual station readings" are associated with events and how analysts check "station coverage."]

Query both catalogs using overlapping spatiotemporal search windows rather than attempting one-to-one ID lookups. [KB:01_usgs_comcat_api.md][KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md] The USGS API supports geographic searches via box coordinates or radial distance with magnitude filtering. [KB:01_usgs_comcat_api.md] The ISC API provides similar geographic search capabilities with the `includeallorigins=true` parameter to retrieve all contributing agency solutions. [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md] Comparing the NEIC-contributed origins within ISC events against USGS events provides the most direct matching path given NEIC's role as a major contributor to both systems. [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md][KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md]^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All statements are well-supported by KB documents. The recommendation for spatiotemporal search windows follows from the absence of direct ID linkage documented in 03_cross_reference_findings.md. The USGS API geographic search capabilities are documented in 01_usgs_comcat_api.md in the "Query Parameters" section (lines 51-60): "Rectangle: minlatitude, maxlatitude, minlongitude, maxlongitude" and "Circle: latitude, longitude, maxradius or maxradiuskm" along with magnitude filters (lines 68-70). The ISC API capabilities are documented in 02_isc_bulletin_api.md (lines 67-105) including geographic searches and the includeallorigins parameter (lines 101-105): "includeallorigins - Include all agency origins (default: false)" and "From documentation: 'Using `contributor` parameter automatically sets `includeallorigins` to true.'" The NEIC matching strategy is supported by 02_isc_bulletin_api.md listing NEIC as a major contributor (line 59) and 03_cross_reference_findings.md documenting NEIC's one-third contribution (line 102).]

## Conclusion

No direct cross-reference mechanism exists between USGS ComCat event IDs and ISC Bulletin event IDs. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md] The two catalogs use incompatible identifier formats (alphanumeric with network prefixes versus purely numeric), operate on different timescales (real-time versus 24-month reviewed bulletin), and serve different purposes (comprehensive real-time reporting versus definitive global archive). [KB:01_usgs_comcat_api.md][KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md][KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md]^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All statements are well-supported by KB documents. The absence of cross-reference is documented in 03_cross_reference_findings.md "What Was NOT Found" section (lines 196-205) and emphasized in README.md (lines 13-15): "No explicit cross-reference mechanism between USGS ComCat event IDs and ISC Bulletin event IDs was found in official documentation." The incompatible identifier formats are documented in 03_cross_reference_findings.md "ID Format Differences" section (lines 135-149). The timescale difference is documented in 03_cross_reference_findings.md "Catalog Timelines" (lines 128-133) with USGS providing "Near real-time earthquake reporting" and ISC's "Reviewed version typically 24 months behind real-time operations." The different purposes are stated in 02_isc_bulletin_api.md (line 7): ISC as "definitive record of the Earth's seismicity" and 01_usgs_comcat_api.md (line 7) describing ComCat as aggregating data from "multiple seismic networks" for comprehensive coverage.]

Seismologists address this challenge using spatiotemporal matching algorithms with magnitude-dependent distance and time windows, following established methods such as Gardner and Knopoff (1974) and Reasenberg (1985). [WEB:Gardner & Knopoff search results][WEB:Reasenberg search results] The ISC's own association process combines time-based algorithms with extensive manual review by expert seismologists. [WEB:ISC association search results][WEB:https://geoscienceletters.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40562-020-00164-6] Any implementation of cross-catalog matching must similarly combine automated proximity algorithms with manual validation to prevent errors such as merging mainshocks with aftershocks or incorrectly associating events from earthquake swarms. [KB:task.md]^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All three statements are well-supported. The first statement about seismologists using spatiotemporal algorithms is supported by the web search results documenting Gardner & Knopoff (1974) and Reasenberg (1985) as established methods widely used in the field. The second statement about ISC's process is directly supported by multiple web sources: ISC association search results stating "The present association algorithm depends on time only" and "the final editing of events...is always carried out by seismologists who scrutinise the output" and the Storchak et al. 2020 WebFetch confirming manual review of ISC solutions. The third statement about preventing errors directly addresses the user's concern in task.md (lines 3-6) about "catastrophic mistakes like merging a mainshock with its aftershocks" and the AI's previous failure with "arbitrary thresholds...that would have destroyed the database."]

The most practical approach leverages the NEIC's role as a major contributor to both systems. [KB:03_cross_reference_findings.md] Query ISC bulletin data with `contributor=NEIC` to retrieve origins computed by NEIC, then match these against USGS ComCat events using spatiotemporal proximity. [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md] This approach minimizes ambiguity by comparing solutions from the same source agency while accepting that some events will remain unmatchable due to differences in reporting coverage and quality control decisions between the two catalogs. [KB:02_isc_bulletin_api.md][WEB:https://geoscienceletters.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40562-020-00164-6]^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All three statements are supported by the evidence. The NEIC's role as a major contributor is documented in 03_cross_reference_findings.md (line 102): "NEIC PDE program contributes about one-third of all data used by the ISC" and in 02_isc_bulletin_api.md listing NEIC among major contributors (line 59). The query approach using contributor parameter is documented in 02_isc_bulletin_api.md (lines 92-96): "contributor - e.g., 'NEIC MOS'" and "From documentation: 'Using `contributor` parameter automatically sets `includeallorigins` to true.'" The statement about unmatchable events acknowledges the documented challenges: ISC's removal of poorly constrained events (WebFetch from Storchak et al. 2020), split event problems (02_isc_bulletin_api.md lines 166-168), and different quality control decisions between catalogs. This represents a realistic assessment based on the documented complexities of the two systems.]
