# South Deep Gold Mine Seismic Hazard Assessment Review

## Context

The South Deep Gold Mine in South Africa commissioned a site-specific Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Assessment (PSHA) conducted by the Seismology Research Centre (SRC) through SLR Consulting for the Tailings Storage Facilities at two locations: the Doornpoort New Facility and the South Deep Four Old Dams site. The SRC assessment, documented in the June 2025 draft report, produced Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) values substantially higher than previously adopted design values from 2008-2009, with 0.33 g for the 475-year return period and 1.3 g for the 10,000-year return period, compared to prior values of 0.15 g and 0.25 g respectively. These elevated ground motion intensities raised concerns about their impact on stability and deformation analyses, prompting SLR Consulting to recommend a third-party review focused on identifying the causes of discrepancies between SRC seismic intensity values and regional reference estimates, as well as evaluating the influence of mining-related seismicity on the resultant PGA values. The specialized nature of seismic hazard assessment in the South African stable continental region setting, combined with the significant impact that higher PGA values would have on engineering design decisions and project economics, underscored the need for independent verification of the methodology and parameterization employed in the SRC model.

## Benchmarking Analysis

The SRC PSHA results exhibit systematic deviation from established reference values across multiple independent assessments. For the 475-year return period, SRC estimated 0.329 g while SRK Consulting values range from 0.055 g to 0.088 g, the Global Earthquake Model (GEM 2023) displays 0.017 g to 0.149 g, and the historical Global Seismic Hazard Assessment Program (GSHAP) estimated less than 0.01 g for the region. The SRC weighted mean exceeds the upper SRK bound by a factor of approximately 2.2. For the 10,000-year return period, SRC estimated 1.328 g compared to SRK's range of 0.232 g to 0.386 g, with SRC exceeding the upper SRK bound by a factor of approximately 3.4. Modern probabilistic seismic hazard analyses in stable continental regions typically exhibit epistemic uncertainty arising from multiple sources including source model selection with varying activity rates and maximum magnitudes, choice of ground-motion prediction equations calibrated on different regional datasets, treatment of site amplification effects, and inclusion or exclusion of local fault sources that may dominate hazard at short distances. These discrepancies cannot be attributed to methodological deficiencies in the SRC assessment, which follows state-of-the-art PSHA practices including well-structured logic tree frameworks, regionally appropriate ground motion prediction equations, and explicit treatment of epistemic uncertainties. The systematic elevation of hazard estimates across both return periods, with consistent divergence from all regional reference ranges, suggests that the increased ground motion intensities result from the specific combination of source parameters assigned to the Reitfontein Fault, which the SRC assessment treats as a discrete source with maximum magnitude $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$. The benchmarking analysis indicates that the parameterization of this fault dominates the hazard at the site, producing PGA values substantially higher than regional baselines derived from alternative source characterizations.

## Reitfontein Fault Characterization Issues

The Reitfontein Fault characterization exhibits several critical deficiencies that amplify its contribution to probabilistic seismic hazard for return periods less than 10,000 years. First, the fault lacks documented geological or geomorphological evidence of neotectonic activity, with no observable surface ruptures, displaced young sediments, or geomorphic signs of recent faulting consistent with the standard definition of an active fault having produced historical earthquakes or showing movement within the last 35,000 years. Singh et al. (2009) reported only minor present-day seismic activity along the structure and specifically identified the Reitfontein Fault as requiring reassessment to determine current activity status, indicating that its classification as an active neotectonic structure with a slip rate of 1 m per million years represents a conservative engineering assumption rather than demonstrated activity supported by empirical evidence. The absence of paleoseismic investigations represents a critical data gap. Second, the assigned maximum magnitude of $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$ derived from Wells and Coppersmith (1994) length-magnitude scaling relationships applied to the 64 km mapped fault length exceeds the largest recorded South African earthquake (the 1969 Ceres event at $M_w$ 6.2) by 1.0 magnitude unit, representing a 32-fold difference in seismic moment release, and falls at the extreme upper end of regional $M_{\text{max}}$ assignments for stable continental settings where most South African PSHA models assign values ranging from 5.3 to 6.3. While the 64 km rupture length provides a reasonable basis for magnitude estimation, this approach provides only an upper bound on potential earthquake size without addressing the probability that such earthquakes can occur within relevant timeframes for engineering design, and not all mapped fault lengths necessarily represent seismogenic lengths capable of rupturing in a single earthquake. Stable continental region earthquakes may exhibit different scaling behaviors than the active tectonic region earthquakes dominating the Wells and Coppersmith dataset. Third, the 43 km distance from South Deep Mine and the depth separation between mining operations (maximum depth 4 km) and seismogenic depths (5 to 16 km for natural events, with stable continental regions extending to 15-25 km) indicate that Reitfontein Fault seismicity would be primarily tectonic rather than mining-induced, with mining-induced triggering of full-fault rupture considered highly unlikely, though stress perturbations from mining may contribute to reactivation of fault segments. The fundamental problem is that paleoseismic faults in stable continental regions typically exhibit recurrence intervals of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, with studies of Australian cratonic faults documenting quiescent intervals of at least 10,000 and commonly 100,000 years or more between episodes of activity, yet the PSHA parameterization implicitly assumes the fault can generate $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$ events within return periods less than 10,000 years. This temporal inconsistency between the fault's apparent paleoseismic character and its treatment in the hazard model as an active structure capable of influencing hazard at relatively short return periods drives the disproportionate contribution to design-basis hazard estimates.

## Recommendations

The temporal probability of full-fault rupture events requires explicit modeling through PSHA logic tree restructuring. For faults exhibiting paleoseismic rather than neotectonic character, PSHA logic trees should include branches that explicitly model long recurrence intervals (50,000 to 200,000 years) for maximum magnitude events, reflecting the typical behavior of stable continental region structures. This temporal modeling can be implemented through logic tree branches that apply characteristic earthquake models with extended recurrence intervals for the largest events, while maintaining Gutenberg-Richter distributions for moderate magnitudes consistent with instrumental seismicity. The weighting structure should heavily favor branches that exclude significant contribution from $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$ events to return periods less than 10,000 years, as the geological and seismotectonic evidence does not support such frequent occurrence of large-magnitude ruptures on the Reitfontein Fault. This approach maintains conservatism for very long return periods relevant to critical facilities while providing realistic hazard estimates for the design-basis return periods (475 and 10,000 years) that govern engineering decisions for the tailings storage facilities.
