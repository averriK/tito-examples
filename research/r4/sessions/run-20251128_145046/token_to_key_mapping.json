The fault is located 43 km from South Deep Mine, with mining operations reaching maximum depths of 4 km while seismogenic depths in stable continental regions extend to 15-25 km, indicating that Reitfontein seismicity would be primarily tectonic rather than mining-induced.

The assigned maximum magnitude of $M_{\\text{max}} = 7.2$ derived from Wells and Coppersmith (1994) length-magnitude scaling relationships for a 64 km fault represents an unusually high value for the South African stable continental region, exceeding the largest recorded earthquake in South Africa (the 1969 Ceres event at $M_w$ 6.2) by 1.0 magnitude unit, equivalent to 32 times the seismic moment release [KB:reitfontein.md]. In stable continental regions, faults may behave episodically with ground-rupturing events recurring at intervals of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, and paleoseismic studies emphasize the risks of relying solely on instrumental records in settings with such long recurrence intervals [KB:reitfontein.md][ARXIV:https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018EGUGA..20.8378C]. However, the classification of the Reitfontein Fault as an active neotectonic structure with a slip rate of 1 m/Myr represents a conservative engineering assumption rather than demonstrated activity supported by empirical evidence, creating a fundamental mismatch between the fault's apparent paleoseismic character and its treatment in the hazard model as a source capable of influencing hazard at relatively short return periods [KB:reitfontein.md]. The 43 km distance from South Deep Mine and the depth separation between mining operations (≤4 km) and seismogenic depths (5-16 km for natural events) indicate that mining-induced triggering of full-fault rupture is highly unlikely, though stress perturbations from mining may contribute to reactivation of fault segments [KB:reitfontein.md].",
