These elevated results motivated a third-party review to investigate discrepancies between SRC seismic intensity values and regional reference estimates, and to evaluate the influence of mining-related seismicity on the modeling and resultant PGA values. The specialized nature of seismic hazard assessment in the South African stable continental region setting, combined with the significant impact that higher PGA values would have on stability and deformation analyses, underscored the need for independent verification of the methodology and parameterization employed in the SRC model.

The fault's classification as an active neotectonic structure represents a conservative engineering assumption rather than demonstrated activity, as no geological or geomorphological evidence exists for movement within the last 35,000 years, the standard threshold for active fault designation. The assigned maximum magnitude $M_{\\text{max}} = 7.2$ exceeds the largest recorded South African earthquake (1969 Ceres event, $M_w$ 6.2) by 1.0 magnitude unit, representing a 32-fold difference in seismic moment release, and falls at the upper end of regional $M_{\\text{max}}$ assignments for stable continental settings. This magnitude estimate derives from Wells and Coppersmith (1994) scaling relationships applied to the 64 km mapped fault length, but this approach provides only an upper bound on potential earthquake size without addressing the probability that such earthquakes can occur within relevant timeframes for engineering design. The fault is located 43 km from South Deep Mine, with mining operations reaching maximum depths of 4 km while seismogenic depths in stable continental regions extend to 15-25 km, indicating that Reitfontein seismicity would be primarily tectonic rather than mining-induced. The fundamental issue is that paleoseismic faults in stable continental regions typically exhibit recurrence intervals of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, yet the PSHA parameterization implicitly assumes the fault can generate $M_{\\text{max}} = 7.2$ events within return periods less than 10,000 years.

For faults exhibiting paleoseismic rather than neotectonic character, PSHA logic trees should include branches that explicitly model long recurrence intervals (50,000 to 200,000 years) for maximum magnitude events, reflecting the typical behavior of stable continental region structures. This temporal modeling can be implemented through logic tree branches that apply characteristic earthquake models with extended recurrence intervals for the largest events, while maintaining Gutenberg-Richter distributions for moderate magnitudes consistent with instrumental seismicity. The weighting structure should heavily favor branches that exclude significant contribution from $M_{\\text{max}} = 7.2$ events to return periods less than 10,000 years, as the geological and seismotectonic evidence does not support such frequent occurrence of large-magnitude ruptures on the Reitfontein Fault.

The fault lacks documented geological or geomorphological evidence of neotectonic activity, with no observable surface ruptures, displaced young sediments, or geomorphic signs of recent faulting consistent with the standard definition of an active fault having produced movement within the last 35,000 years [KB:reitfontein.md][WEB:https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3263/14/3/68]. The absence of paleoseismic investigations represents a critical data gap, and Singh et al. (2009) specifically identified the Reitfontein Fault as requiring reassessment to determine current activity status, noting only minor present-day seismic activity along the structure [KB:reitfontein.md]. The assigned maximum magnitude of $M_{\\text{max}} = 7.2$ derived from Wells and Coppersmith (1994) length-magnitude scaling relationships for a 64 km fault represents an unusually high value for the South African stable continental region, exceeding the largest recorded earthquake in South Africa (the 1969 Ceres event at $M_w$ 6.2) by 1.0 magnitude unit, equivalent to 32 times the seismic moment release [KB:reitfontein.md]. In stable continental regions, faults may behave episodically with ground-rupturing events recurring at intervals of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, and paleoseismic studies emphasize the risks of relying solely on instrumental records in settings with such long recurrence intervals [KB:reitfontein.md][ARXIV:https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018EGUGA..20.8378C]. However, the classification of the Reitfontein Fault as an active neotectonic structure with a slip rate of 1 m/Myr represents a conservative engineering assumption rather than demonstrated activity supported by empirical evidence, creating a fundamental mismatch between the fault's apparent paleoseismic character and its treatment in the hazard model as a source capable of influencing hazard at relatively short return periods [KB:reitfontein.md]. The 43 km distance from South Deep Mine and the depth separation between mining operations (≤4 km) and seismogenic depths (5-16 km for natural events) indicate that mining-induced triggering of full-fault rupture is highly unlikely, though stress perturbations from mining may contribute to reactivation of fault segments [KB:reitfontein.md].",

      "content": "Comparative assessment of peak ground acceleration values from four independent sources reveals systematic divergences between the SRC site-specific analysis and regional reference models. The SRC weighted mean values of 0.329 g and 1.328 g for the 475-year and 10,000-year return periods, respectively, substantially exceed the range of values from other authoritative sources. The Global Seismic Hazard Assessment Program baseline estimates yielded values less than 0.01 g for the 475-year return period, representing the lowest hazard characterization. The Global Earthquake Model version 2023.1 produced peak ground acceleration ranging from 0.017 g to 0.149 g for the 475-year return period at reference rock conditions with $V_{s30}$ between 760 and 800 m/s. SRK Consulting estimates at site-specific conditions with $V_{s30} = 600$ m/s fell within the range of 0.055 g to 0.088 g for the 475-year return period and 0.232 g to 0.386 g for the 10,000-year return period. The SRC weighted mean values exceed the upper bounds of the SRK reference ranges by factors of approximately 2.2 and 3.4 for the two return periods. The methodological framework employed by SRC conforms to state-of-the-art probabilistic seismic hazard analysis standards, incorporating well-structured logic tree frameworks, regionally appropriate ground motion prediction equations, and explicit treatment of epistemic uncertainties. The systematic elevation in hazard estimates cannot be attributed to methodological deficiencies or implementation errors but appears to result from specific source parameterization decisions, particularly the characterization of the Reitfontein Fault as an active discrete source with maximum magnitude $M_{\\max} = 7.2$ [KB:benchmark.md][WEB:https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/science/risk].",

      "content": "The Reitfontein Fault exhibits multiple deficiencies in epistemic characterization that significantly affect probabilistic seismic hazard analysis results for return periods less than 10,000 years. The fault lacks geological or geomorphological evidence of neotectonic activity, with no documented surface ruptures, displaced young sediments, or geomorphic signs of recent faulting consistent with the standard definition of an active fault producing historical earthquakes or showing movement within the last 35,000 years. Singh et al. (2009) reported only minor present-day seismic activity along the fault and specifically identified the Reitfontein Fault as requiring reassessment to determine current activity status. The classification as an active neotectonic structure with a slip rate of 1 m per million years represents a conservative engineering assumption rather than demonstrated activity. The assigned maximum magnitude of $M_{\\text{max}} = 7.2$ based on a 64 km fault length using Wells and Coppersmith (1994) empirical relationships exceeds the largest recorded South African earthquake, the 1969 Ceres event with magnitude $M_{w} = 6.2$, by 1.0 magnitude unit, corresponding to a 32-fold difference in seismic moment release. Regional maximum magnitude assignments from current South African probabilistic seismic hazard models range from 5.3 to 6.3 for most zones, with the $M_{\\text{max}} = 7.2$ value falling at the upper extreme of regional characterizations. In stable continental regions such as South Africa, paleoseismic faults typically exhibit recurrence intervals of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, with studies of Australian cratonic faults documenting quiescent intervals of at least 10,000 and commonly 100,000 years or more between episodes of activity. The 43 km distance from South Deep Mine and depth separation between mining operations reaching 4 km and seismogenic depths of 5 to 16 km for natural events indicate that Reitfontein Fault seismicity would be primarily tectonic rather than mining-induced, with mining-induced triggering of full-fault rupture considered highly unlikely. The fundamental problem is that a fault with paleoseismic characteristics and long recurrence intervals should not dominate hazard estimates at return periods of 475 and 10,000 years [KB:reitfontein.md][WEB:https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018TC005365][WEB:https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/70025144].",
