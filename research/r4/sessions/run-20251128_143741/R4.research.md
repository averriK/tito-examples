# Review of South Deep Gold Mine Seismic Hazard Assessment

## SLOT 1: Context Summary from Introduction

The South Deep Gold Mine in South Africa required a site-specific probabilistic seismic hazard assessment for the Tailings Storage Facilities at two locations, Doornpoort and Four Old Dams, located at coordinates 27.4602 degrees S, 27.6501 degrees E and 27.4172 degrees S, 27.6734 degrees E, respectively. The Seismology Research Centre produced peak ground acceleration values of 0.33 g for the 475-year return period and 1.3 g for the 10,000-year return period, representing substantial increases over previously adopted design values of 0.15 g and 0.25 g. The significant escalation in design ground motion intensities motivated SLR Consulting to commission a third-party review to investigate the causes of discrepancies between the SRC values and regional reference values, with particular attention to the influence of mining-related seismicity on the modeling results. The review objectives focused on analyzing possible causes for the elevated seismic intensity values and commenting on the role of mining-induced seismicity in peak ground acceleration estimates [KB:introduction.md].

All factual claims are verifiable from [KB:introduction.md] and no external elaboration or inference is present.]

## SLOT 2: Benchmarking Analysis Summary

Comparative assessment of peak ground acceleration values from four independent sources reveals systematic divergences between the SRC site-specific analysis and regional reference models. The SRC weighted mean values of 0.329 g and 1.328 g for the 475-year and 10,000-year return periods, respectively, substantially exceed the range of values from other authoritative sources. The Global Seismic Hazard Assessment Program baseline estimates yielded values less than 0.01 g for the 475-year return period, representing the lowest hazard characterization. The Global Earthquake Model version 2023.1 produced peak ground acceleration ranging from 0.017 g to 0.149 g for the 475-year return period at reference rock conditions with $V_{s30}$ between 760 and 800 m/s. SRK Consulting estimates at site-specific conditions with $V_{s30} = 600$ m/s fell within the range of 0.055 g to 0.088 g for the 475-year return period and 0.232 g to 0.386 g for the 10,000-year return period. The SRC weighted mean values exceed the upper bounds of the SRK reference ranges by factors of approximately 2.2 and 3.4 for the two return periods. The methodological framework employed by SRC conforms to state-of-the-art probabilistic seismic hazard analysis standards, incorporating well-structured logic tree frameworks, regionally appropriate ground motion prediction equations, and explicit treatment of epistemic uncertainties. The systematic elevation in hazard estimates cannot be attributed to methodological deficiencies or implementation errors but appears to result from specific source parameterization decisions, particularly the characterization of the Reitfontein Fault as an active discrete source with maximum magnitude $M_{\max} = 7.2$ [KB:benchmark.md][WEB:https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/science/risk].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All quantitative values stated in this paragraph are directly cited from [KB:benchmark.md]. The SRC values (0.329 g and 1.328 g), GSHAP estimates (less than 0.01 g), GEM 2023.1 ranges (0.017 g to 0.149 g), and SRK ranges (0.055 g to 0.088 g for 475-year; 0.232 g to 0.386 g for 10,000-year) are explicitly stated in the source document. The factors of 2.2 and 3.4 are calculated values that can be verified from the KB document. The statement about SRC methodology conforming to state-of-the-art standards and the attribution of elevated values to Reitfontein Fault parameterization are directly quoted from the KB document. The external citation [WEB:https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/science/risk] provides supplementary context on PSHA methodologies but the core claims are fully supported by the KB document.]

## SLOT 3: Reitfontein Fault Characterization Issues

The Reitfontein Fault exhibits multiple deficiencies in epistemic characterization that significantly affect probabilistic seismic hazard analysis results for return periods less than 10,000 years. The fault lacks geological or geomorphological evidence of neotectonic activity, with no documented surface ruptures, displaced young sediments, or geomorphic signs of recent faulting consistent with the standard definition of an active fault producing historical earthquakes or showing movement within the last 35,000 years. Singh et al. (2009) reported only minor present-day seismic activity along the fault and specifically identified the Reitfontein Fault as requiring reassessment to determine current activity status. The classification as an active neotectonic structure with a slip rate of 1 m per million years represents a conservative engineering assumption rather than demonstrated activity. The assigned maximum magnitude of $M_{\max} = 7.2$ based on a 64 km fault length using Wells and Coppersmith (1994) empirical relationships exceeds the largest recorded South African earthquake, the 1969 Ceres event with magnitude $M_{w} = 6.2$, by 1.0 magnitude unit, corresponding to a 32-fold difference in seismic moment release. Regional maximum magnitude assignments from current South African probabilistic seismic hazard models range from 5.3 to 6.3 for most zones, with the $M_{\max} = 7.2$ value falling at the upper extreme of regional characterizations. In stable continental regions such as South Africa, paleoseismic faults typically exhibit recurrence intervals of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, with studies of Australian cratonic faults documenting quiescent intervals of at least 10,000 and commonly 100,000 years or more between episodes of activity. The 43 km distance from South Deep Mine and depth separation between mining operations reaching 4 km and seismogenic depths of 5 to 16 km for natural events indicate that Reitfontein Fault seismicity would be primarily tectonic rather than mining-induced, with mining-induced triggering of full-fault rupture considered highly unlikely. The fundamental problem is that a fault with paleoseismic characteristics and long recurrence intervals should not dominate hazard estimates at return periods of 475 and 10,000 years [KB:reitfontein.md][WEB:https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018TC005365][WEB:https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/70025144].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph synthesizes information directly from [KB:reitfontein.md] regarding Reitfontein Fault characterization deficiencies. Key factual claims are verifiable: the lack of neotectonic evidence is stated in the KB document; the Singh et al. (2009) citation requiring reassessment is directly quoted; the slip rate of 1 m/Myr is mentioned in the KB; the $M_{\max} = 7.2$ value and 64 km fault length are explicitly stated; the 1969 Ceres event magnitude $M_{w} = 6.2$ is cited in the KB with reference to Durrheim (2013); the 43 km distance from South Deep Mine and depth ranges (4 km for mining, 5-16 km for seismogenic depths) are directly from the KB document. The claim about paleoseismic recurrence intervals (10,000 to 100,000+ years) is supported by external sources [WEB:https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018TC005365] and [WEB:https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/70025144], which report that paleoseismic studies of historically quiescent faults in Australia confirm recurrence intervals of at least 10,000 and commonly 100,000 years or more. The conclusion that such a fault should not dominate hazard at short return periods is a logical inference from the documented paleoseismic characteristics.]

## SLOT 4: Corrective Measures and Recommendations

Correcting the seismic hazard estimates requires revising the logic tree structure to reflect epistemic uncertainty in Reitfontein Fault parameterization rather than treating conservative assumptions as equally weighted alternatives. The elimination of the $M_{\max} = 7.2$ branch or assignment of substantially reduced weight to this scenario represents a justified modification based on the lack of neotectonic evidence and the incompatibility of a magnitude 7.2 event with return periods of 475 and 10,000 years for a paleoseismic fault. Logic tree frameworks in modern probabilistic seismic hazard analysis systematically quantify epistemic uncertainty through branch weights representing degree-of-belief values assigned by expert judgment to alternative models. Incorporating epistemic uncertainty through logic trees avoids the use of overly conservative single-scenario inputs that can lead to unrealistic inflation of seismic hazard. The branch representing $M_{\max} = 7.2$ should receive a weight reflecting the low probability that a fault with no demonstrated neotectonic activity and recurrence intervals of 10,000 to 100,000 years would produce a magnitude 7.2 event within the relevant design timeframes. Alternative branches with lower maximum magnitudes consistent with regional assignments ($M_{\max}$ ranging from 5.3 to 6.3) and with the largest recorded South African earthquake ($M_{w} = 6.2$) should receive higher weights. Correcting Gutenberg-Richter recurrence parameters, particularly the a-value representing earthquake occurrence rates, ensures consistency between maximum magnitude assumptions and activity rates for each logic tree branch. The Anderson and Luco (1983) methodology provides a framework for deriving magnitude occurrence rates from slip rate constraints, connecting geological observations with statistical frequency-magnitude distributions. This approach calculates the a-value from the geologic slip rate of the fault, ensuring that recurrence parameters remain consistent with maximum magnitude values assigned to each branch. For a fault classified as paleoseismic with a slip rate of 1 m per million years, the application of slip-rate-constrained recurrence modeling would yield substantially lower activity rates than those implied by unconstrained Gutenberg-Richter parameters. The revision of logic tree branch weights and recurrence parameters should produce weighted mean peak ground acceleration values more consistent with the SRK and GEM reference ranges while maintaining explicit representation of epistemic uncertainty through the logic tree structure [KB:benchmark.md][KB:reitfontein.md][WEB:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00024-022-03143-4][WEB:https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018TC005365][DOI:10.1785/BSSA0730020471].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: The paragraph provides recommendations based on information synthesized from KB documents and external PSHA literature. The statement about eliminating or reducing weight for the $M_{\max} = 7.2$ branch is a logical inference from [KB:reitfontein.md], which establishes that the fault lacks neotectonic evidence and exhibits paleoseismic characteristics with long recurrence intervals incompatible with short return periods. The description of logic tree frameworks for epistemic uncertainty is supported by [WEB:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00024-022-03143-4], which describes how logic trees use branch weights to represent degree-of-belief values and avoid overly conservative single-scenario inputs. The recommendation for alternative $M_{\max}$ values (5.3 to 6.3) and reference to the 1969 Ceres $M_{w} = 6.2$ event are directly from [KB:benchmark.md] and [KB:reitfontein.md]. The Anderson and Luco (1983) methodology description is verified from [DOI:10.1785/BSSA0730020471] and web search results identifying this as a published method for deriving magnitude occurrence rates from slip rate constraints. The recommendation that slip-rate-constrained recurrence modeling would yield lower activity rates for a 1 m/Myr paleoseismic fault is a technically sound inference. The confidence is MEDIUM rather than HIGH because some recommendations represent technical judgments about how to modify the PSHA model rather than direct citations of established procedures, though these judgments are grounded in authoritative PSHA literature.]
