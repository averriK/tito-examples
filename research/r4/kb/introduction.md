## Background

The South Deep Gold Mine is located in South Africa, with two sites of interest: the Doornpoort (New Facility) at coordinates 27.4602°S, 27.6501°E, and South Deep (Four Old Dams) at 27.4172°S, 27.6734°E . South Deep Gold Mine commissioned SLR Consulting (South Africa) to conduct a site-specific Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Assessment (PSHA) for the South Deep Tailings Storage Facilities (TSFs). 

The objectives of the study were to provide an improved site-specific seismic characterization compared to that adopted in the 2008/2009 design of the Doornpoort TSF. The seismology work was conducted by the Seismology Research Centre (SRC), a division of ESS Earth Sciences Proprietary Limited, and documented in the report entitled "South Deep Gold Mine, Seismic Hazard Assessment - June 2025 (Draft Report)". The source document is available at the following URL:

For the Doornpoort site, the SRC PSHA work produced Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) values that were considerably higher than the previously adopted values and represented a substantial increase over those values for the project site. Given the specialized nature of the subject, SLR Consulting recommended that a third-party review be undertaken on the SRC PSHA work . Additionally, SLR recommended that the third-party reviewer comment on the influence of mining-related seismicity on the modeling and the resulting PGA values. These recommendations were motivated by concerns that adopting higher SRC PGA values would significantly affect stability and deformation analyses.

## Objectives

The objectives of this work are to conduct a third-party review of the Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Assessment model developed by the Seismology Research Centre, to analyze the possible causes for discrepancies between the seismic intensity values (peak ground acceleration and pseudo-spectral acceleration) provided by SRC and the regional reference values, and to comment on the influence of mining-related seismicity on the modeling and the resultant peak ground acceleration values.
