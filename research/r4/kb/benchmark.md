## PGA Comparative Assessment

Seismic hazard assessment for the South Deep Gold Mine site in South Africa requires evaluating ground motion intensity values derived from probabilistic seismic hazard analysis. This chapter presents a comparative assessment of probabilistic seismic hazard analysis models developed for the South Deep Gold Mine site in South Africa. The assessment examines peak ground acceleration (PGA) values derived from three independent analyses conducted by Seismology Research Centre, SRK Consulting, and the Global Earthquake Model consortium, alongside the Global Seismic Hazard Assessment Program historical baseline. The chapter evaluates the range of PGA estimates for two critical return periods—475 years (10 percent probability of exceedance in 50 years) and 10,000 years (0.5 percent probability of exceedance in 50 years).

### SRC 

Peak ground acceleration estimates provided by Seismology Research Centre for the South Deep Gold Mine Doornpoort site exhibit a substantial increase relative to previously adopted design values. SRC produced site-specific calculations yielding 0.33 g for the 475-year return period and 1.3 g for the 10,000-year return period, assuming $V_{s30} = 600$ m/s, values considerably higher than previously adopted design criteria of 0.15 g and 0.25 g, respectively.  The SRC methodology employed an equally weighted ensemble of three seismic source models: the EZ-FRISK Africa model, the Global Earthquake Model South Africa model, and a smoothed seismicity model. All three source models incorporate the Reitfontein Fault as an active (neotectonic) structure.  Individual contributions from the three source models demonstrate considerable epistemic uncertainty. For the 475-year return period, the EZ-FRISK model contributed 0.157 g, the GEM model yielded 0.564 g, and the smoothed seismicity model produced 0.103 g, with a weighted mean of 0.329 g. For the 10,000-year return period, corresponding values were 0.696 g, 1.892 g, and 0.432 g, with a weighted mean of 1.328 g. [@PSHADeepSouth2025].

### GSHA

The Global Seismic Hazard Assessment Program (GSHAP), operating from 1992 to 1999 under the United Nations International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction framework, established early baseline hazard estimates for the South Deep site region. The GSHAP assessment, which calculated ground motions with 10 percent probability of exceedance in 50 years (475-year return period) on a global scale, estimated PGA values of less than 0.01 g for the site, representing substantially lower hazard characterization than contemporary models. [@PSHADeepSouth2025][@USGSHazards2024]. 

### GEM

The Global Earthquake Model (GEM), version 2023.1, incorporates updated seismic source characterizations and modern ground motion models, calculating PGA with 10 percent probability of exceedance in 50 years for reference rock conditions with $V_{s30}$ between 760 and 800 m/s using the OpenQuake engine. The map was compiled from 31 national and regional probabilistic seismic hazard models developed by various institutions in collaboration with GEM Foundation scientists. For the South Deep Gold Mine Doornpoort site, the GEM 2023 map displays peak ground acceleration ranging from 0.017 g to 0.149 g with elevated hazard concentrated in gold mining regions where induced seismicity contributes to the total seismic hazard [@GEMHazardMap2023][@OpenQuake2023].

### SRK

SRK Consulting developed probabilistic seismic hazard assessments for the South African region employing logic trees of ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs) developed from stable continental crust (SCC)  global datasets including European, North American, and Canadian cratons. SRK PGA estimates at the site-specific $V_{s30} = 600$ m/s condition for the 475-year return period fall in the range of 0.055 g to 0.088 g, substantially lower than the SRC weighted mean of 0.329 g, while the 10,000-year estimates range from 0.232 g to 0.386 g, also markedly below the SRC value of 1.328 g (see Appendix for details). The systematic differences reflect multiple sources of epistemic uncertainty: the selection of source models with different activity rates and maximum magnitudes, the choice of ground-motion models calibrated on different regional datasets, the treatment of site amplification effects, and the inclusion or exclusion of local fault sources that may dominate hazard at short distances. The SRC weighted mean values of 0.329 g and 1.328 g exceed the upper bounds of these reference ranges by factors of approximately 2.2 and 3.4, respectively.

### Discussion

The SRC assessment follows state-of-the-art methodologies in probabilistic seismic hazard analysis, incorporating a well-structured logic tree framework, regionally appropriate ground motion prediction equations, and explicit treatment of epistemic uncertainties. The significant deviation from regional reference values cannot be explained by methodological limitations or errors in implementation. The SRC assessment, which considers the Reitfontein Fault as a discrete source with a maximum magnitude of $M_{	ext{max}} = 7.2$, consistently yields higher hazard estimates. This suggests that the increased ground motion intensities may result from the specific combination of source parameters assigned to this fault. The next chapter provides a detailed analysis of the Reitfontein Fault's characterization and its parameterization within the seismic source model [@PSHADeepSouth2025].
