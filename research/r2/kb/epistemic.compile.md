# Epistemic Uncertainty Analysis of the Reitfontein Fault for Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Assessment

## Introduction

The Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Assessment (PSHA) for the South Deep Mine in South Africa incorporates the Reitfontein Fault as a seismic source capable of producing a maximum credible earthquake of magnitude $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$. This magnitude determination is based on the Wells and Coppersmith (1994) empirical magnitude-length scaling relationship applied to the fault's 64 km mapped length [@WellsCoppersmith1994]. The fault is modeled with an assigned slip rate of 1 m/Myr, acknowledged as a conservative engineering assumption in the absence of published empirical measurements.

The Reitfontein Fault is located within the Kaapvaal Craton, an Archean cratonic structure formed between 2.7 and 3.7 Ga, representing a Stable Continental Region (SCR) seismotectonic environment. The fault dips to the north at 35 degrees and is oriented approximately east-west. It is positioned 43 km from the South Deep Mine site within the Witwatersrand Basin, a late Archaean to Paleoproterozoic sedimentary basin.

The assignment of $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$ carries substantial epistemic uncertainty given the lack of neotectonic evidence and the SCR tectonic setting. The largest recorded earthquake in South Africa is the September 29, 1969 Ceres event with magnitude $M_w$ 6.2 [@Malagnini2014]. Research on cratonic lithosphere demonstrates that for Archean and Early Proterozoic cratons with seismically determined thick lithosphere, the catalog maximum moment magnitude $M_{c\text{max}} = 6.0$ [@MooneyEtAl2012]. Furthermore, no earthquakes with $M_w > 6$ have occurred above mantle lithosphere with $\delta V_S > 3.5\%$, a characteristic typical of cratonic interiors [@MooneyEtAl2012].

This research addresses six critical questions regarding the seismogenic characterization of the Reitfontein Fault to inform logic tree development for PSHA parameters, particularly focusing on the viability of an $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$ event with a 64 km rupture occurring within a return period less than 1/10,000 years.

## Question 1: Fault Activity Classification - Paleoseismic or Neotectonic?

### Fault Age and Kinematic History

The Reitfontein Fault is at least 2.0 Ga old and has accommodated both normal and oblique reverse movement in the geological past. This ancient fault structure has existed through multiple tectonic episodes affecting the Kaapvaal Craton, including the formation of the Witwatersrand Basin during the late Archaean to Paleoproterozoic.

### Neotectonic Classification Criteria

A neotectonic fault is formally defined as one that has hosted displacement under conditions imposed by the current crustal stress regime. The current crustal stress regime in South Africa was established sometime in the last 40 to 11 million years. Active faults are conventionally defined as structures known to have produced historical earthquakes or shown evidence of movement in the last 35,000 years [@ScienceDirectIntraplate].

### Evidence Assessment for Reitfontein Fault

There is no known geological or geomorphological evidence to suggest neotectonic activity on the Reitfontein Fault. The fault has only been associated with minor present-day seismic activity according to Singh et al. (2009). Critically, Singh et al. (2009) specifically identified the Reitfontein Fault as one of several faults requiring reassessment to determine if still active, indicating that active classification was uncertain even at the time of that synthesis. This identification as requiring reassessment does not constitute evidence of active neotectonic classification.

### Regional Context

Other neotectonic faults in the Kaapvaal Craton include the Zebediela, Thabazimbi, and Moshaweng faults. The Zebediela Fault is associated with thermal springs, and the Moshaweng Fault shows repeated extensional reactivations with recent inversion. These features represent observable geomorphic or structural evidence of recent activity that is notably absent for the Reitfontein Fault.

### Conclusion

The Reitfontein Fault does not meet the conventional criteria for neotectonic classification but appears to be a paleoseismic structure with minor present-day activity. The characterization as a reportedly active fault with an assigned slip rate of 1 m/Myr represents a conservative engineering assumption rather than empirical evidence. The fault is best classified as a paleoseismic structure that may retain some capacity for minor seismic reactivation under the current stress regime but lacks definitive evidence of sustained neotectonic activity.

## Question 2: Evidence for Activity in the Last 35,000 Years

### Direct Evidence Assessment

Based on the comprehensive analysis of knowledge base sources, there is no geological or geomorphological evidence to suggest neotectonic activity on the Reitfontein Fault. No evidence has been documented that would permit affirmation of fault activity within the last 35,000 years. The fault lacks the characteristic indicators of recent activity observed on documented neotectonic faults in South Africa, such as thermal springs, fault scarps displacing young sediments, or geodetic strain accumulation.

### Absence of Paleoseismic Investigation

A field investigation would be required to improve understanding and reduce uncertainties associated with activity rates. Paleoseismic investigations could include trenching, dating of displaced units, or analysis of geomorphological features. The absence of such investigations represents a critical data gap that prevents definitive assessment of Holocene or Late Pleistocene activity.

### Regional Paleoseismic Benchmark

For comparative context, the Kango Fault in the southern Cape Fold Belt provides the most robust paleoseismic evidence for large prehistoric earthquakes in South Africa. Paleoseismic trench investigation found a $2.0 \pm 0.06$ m free-standing fault scarp with moment magnitude estimated between $M_w$ $6.97 \pm 0.01$ and $7.18 \pm 0.01$ [@KangoFaultStudy]. The Kango Fault has measured slip rates on the order of 200 m/Myr, which is 200 times higher than Reitfontein's assigned rate. This demonstrates that faults with demonstrable recent activity in South Africa exhibit substantially higher slip rates and observable surface expression.

### SCR Temporal Characteristics

In stable continental regions, faults may exhibit episodic behavior with recurrence intervals of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years between ground-rupturing events. Paleoseismic studies emphasize the danger of over-reliance on instrumental catalogs in regions with recurrence intervals of 10,000-100,000+ years. The absence of evidence for recent activity does not definitively exclude the possibility of rare, episodic large earthquakes characteristic of SCR settings, but neither does it provide positive evidence for such activity.

### Conclusion

There is no evidence in the analyzed knowledge base that permits affirmation that the Reitfontein Fault had activity in the last 35,000 years. The fault lacks documented surface ruptures, displaced young sediments, geomorphic expression of recent faulting, or other indicators that would satisfy the conventional definition of an active fault. The absence of paleoseismic investigations represents a significant data gap. However, the very low assigned slip rate (1 m/Myr) and lack of observable neotectonic features suggest that if the fault has been active in the last 35,000 years, the activity rate would be at or below detection limits of standard paleoseismic methods [@ResearchGateDetection].

## Question 3: Logic Tree Weights for $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$

### Magnitude-Length Scaling and Uncertainty

The $M_{\text{max}}$ of 7.2 has been determined using the Wells and Coppersmith (1994) relationship for a 64 km fault length [@WellsCoppersmith1994]. Log-linear regressions between earthquake magnitude and surface rupture length showed strong correlations with standard deviations of 0.25 to 0.35 magnitude units [@WellsCoppersmith1994]. This uncertainty range implies that for a 64 km fault, magnitudes could reasonably range from approximately 6.85 to 7.55 based solely on scaling relationship uncertainty.

However, critical caveats apply to this calculation. Not all mapped fault length necessarily represents seismogenic length capable of rupturing in a single earthquake. Additionally, stable continental region earthquakes may exhibit different scaling relationships than active tectonic region earthquakes. The 64 km rupture length assumption is justified as a conservative estimate based on mapped extent, though actual seismogenic length may be considerably shorter.

### Regional and Cratonic Constraints

The $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$ represents an unusually high value for the South African stable continental region. Current South African PSHA models assign $M_{\text{max}}$ values ranging from 5.3-6.3 for most regional zones. The EZ-FRISK Africa model assigns $M_{\text{max}}$ values of 7.23 to the Drakensberg zone and 7.0 to the Kaapvaal zone, covering areas of 820,725 km² and 281,858 km² respectively. The GEM ZAF ZEBED zone has $M_{\text{max}}$ values of 5.28 (weight 0.45), 5.53 (weight 0.35), and 5.93 (weight 0.20).

The Reitfontein Fault's $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$ falls within the range of regional area source values, particularly EZ-FRISK Drakensberg $M_{\text{max}} = 7.23$, but exceeds the more conservative GEM ZAF ZEBED zone estimates. Research on cratonic lithosphere indicates that for cratonic interiors with seismically determined thick lithosphere, the maximum moment magnitude found in the earthquake catalog is $M_{c\text{max}} = 6.0$ [@MooneyEtAl2012]. No earthquakes with $M_w > 6$ have occurred above mantle lithosphere with $\delta V_S > 3.5\%$, a characteristic of cold cratonic regions [@MooneyEtAl2012].

The largest recorded earthquake in South Africa was the Ceres event of September 29, 1969, with magnitude $M_w$ 6.2 [@Malagnini2014]. This represents a 1.0 magnitude unit difference (32 times difference in seismic moment release) from the assigned $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$.

### Global SCR Paleoseismic Evidence

Paleoseismic evidence from stable continental regions globally indicates that prehistoric earthquakes may have greatly exceeded maximum observed instrumental magnitudes. Australian SCR faults, which represent arguably the richest Late Neogene to Quaternary faulting record in SCR crust anywhere in the world, yield $M_{\text{max}}$ estimates of $7.0-7.5 \pm 0.2$ based on multiple documented paleoearthquakes. The Kango Fault paleoseismic evidence in South Africa demonstrates that $M_w$ 6.97-7.18 events are physically possible [@KangoFaultStudy].

## Question 4: Slip Rate Range and Logic Tree Development

### Empirical Slip Rate Data

No slip rate has been published for the Reitfontein Fault; a slip rate of 1 m/Myr is assigned as a conservative assumption. No empirical slip-rate evidence exists for the Reitfontein Fault; the 1 m/Myr value is an engineering assumption. When slip rates are not quantified, they are estimated based on all other available data. For bedrock faults that do not show evidence of movement in the last 10 million years but are included due to favorable orientation, a low uplift rate of 1 m/Myr is assigned.

Research indicates that fault slip rates in the order of 5-10 m/Myr in stable continental regions would be beneath the detection limit of cosmogenic radionuclide methods [@ResearchGateDetection]. This suggests 1 m/Myr represents an exceptionally slow slip rate at or below detection limits for many paleoseismic methods in SCR settings.

### Regional Comparative Data

Some of the more active faults in South Africa have slip rates on the order of 200 m/Myr, such as the Kango Fault. The Kango Fault's 200 m/Myr slip rate is 200 times higher than Reitfontein's assigned rate, yet produces similar maximum magnitudes. The Pretorius Fault is also assigned a slip rate of 1 m/Myr in the absence of published estimates. The 1 m/Myr places Reitfontein at the lower end of the slip-rate spectrum for active structures in South Africa.

### SCR Slip Rate Characteristics

The absence of quantified slip-rate data reflects the general paucity of paleoseismic studies on South African faults. In stable continental regions with thick lithosphere, seismogenic depths typically extend to 15-25 km. The Kaapvaal Craton seismogenic structure has documented activity at 5-16 km depth.

Within intraplate environments, deformation is transient, occurring in discrete episodes separated by long hiatuses [@ScienceDirectIntraplate]. In stable continental regions, faults may exhibit episodic behavior with recurrence intervals of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years between ground-rupturing events.

## Question 5: Seismic Event Probability in <1/10,000 Year Return Period

### Recurrence Calculation Framework

To assess whether the slip rate range permits seismic movements in return periods less than 1/10,000 years (annual probability $> 10^{-4}$), we must consider the relationship between slip rate, earthquake magnitude, and recurrence interval. The characteristic earthquake model and Gutenberg-Richter recurrence relationship provide the framework for this assessment.

### Gutenberg-Richter Recurrence Considerations

The $M_{\text{max}}$ value primarily influences long-return-period hazard estimates (10,000 years and beyond) and deterministic scenario analyses. Disaggregation of the hazard shows that the majority of hazard comes from lower magnitudes for moderate return periods. $M_{\text{max}}$ does not critically affect ground motion recurrence estimates for return periods up to hundreds of years, especially when the b-value is high.

For the Reitfontein Fault with $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$, the minimum magnitude $M_{\text{min}} = 5.7$. For $M_{\text{max}}$ between 6.5 and 7.4, $M_{\text{min}} = M_{\text{max}} - 1.5$, yielding a range of 5.0 to 5.9.

The Gutenberg-Richter equation is $\log_{10}(n) = a_0 - b \times M$. For the Reitfontein Fault, three different b-values are employed: 1.35 (weighted 0.30), 1.10 (weighted 0.60), and 1.99 (weighted 0.10) [@MeletlidisEtAl2014]. A lower b-value means that the ratio of large to small earthquakes is higher, increasing the probability of larger magnitude events.

### SCR Temporal Behavior and Epistemic Constraints

In stable continental regions, faults may exhibit episodic behavior with recurrence intervals of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years between ground-rupturing events. The Kango Fault paleoseismic evidence shows an early Holocene earthquake (approximately 10,000-12,000 years ago) [@KangoFaultStudy], despite having slip rates 200 times higher than Reitfontein.

The largest recorded earthquake in South Africa ($M_w$ 6.2 Ceres, 1969) occurred 56 years ago. No earthquakes with $M_w > 6$ have occurred above mantle lithosphere with $\delta V_S > 3.5\%$, characteristic of cratonic regions [@MooneyEtAl2012]. The catalog maximum moment magnitude for cratonic interiors with thick lithosphere is $M_{c\text{max}} = 6.0$ [@MooneyEtAl2012].

### Critical Caveats

**Absence of Neotectonic Evidence:** The complete lack of geological or geomorphological evidence for recent activity contradicts the slip rates ($\geq$ 1 m/Myr) that would produce observable surface deformation over Holocene timescales.

**Cratonic Constraints:** The $M_{c\text{max}} = 6.0$ constraint for cratonic interiors [@MooneyEtAl2012] suggests that $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$ events may not be physically realizable regardless of return period.

**Episodic Behavior:** SCR faults may have recurrence intervals of 100,000+ years with long periods of quiescence, making deterministic recurrence calculations highly uncertain.

**Mining-Induced Seismicity:** The largest mining-related seismic event ever to occur in South Africa registered magnitude 5.3 on March 9, 2005. Mining-induced seismicity is highly unlikely to trigger rupture of the entire 64 km Reitfontein Fault. Most seismic events associated with mining are localized to the mining area and adjacent structures.

## Question 6: Gutenberg-Richter Parameters and b-value Logic Tree

### Gutenberg-Richter Relationship Framework

The Gutenberg-Richter equation describes the frequency-magnitude distribution of earthquakes: $\log_{10}(n) = a_0 - b \times M$, where $b$ is the Richter b-value, $M$ is magnitude, and $n$ is the number of earthquakes. A lower b-value means that the ratio of large to small earthquakes is higher, increasing the probability of larger magnitude events.

### Current PSHA b-value Implementation

For the Reitfontein Fault, three different b-values are employed: 1.35 (weighted 0.30), 1.10 (weighted 0.60), and 1.99 (weighted 0.10). The dominant weight of 0.60 on the intermediate b-value of 1.10 suggests this is the most representative value for the Reitfontein Fault. The lower b-value of 1.35 with weight 0.30 increases the relative probability of larger magnitude events. The high b-value of 1.99 with low weight of 0.10 represents a scenario where earthquake activity is dominated by smaller events.

### Regional b-value Context

The EZ-FRISK zones have b-values of 1.04 (Drakensberg) and 1.06 (Kaapvaal). These regional b-values of approximately 1.0 are consistent with the global average for tectonic earthquakes. The Reitfontein Fault's central b-value of 1.10 is slightly higher than these regional values, while the weighted b-value of 1.35 is substantially higher.

### Empirical b-value Constraints

Global and regional surveys show empirically determined b-values are remarkably stable, generally limited to values of $1 \pm 0.2$ (i.e., 0.8 to 1.2) [@MeletlidisEtAl2014]. The Reitfontein values of 1.35 and 1.10 fall within or near this typical range [@MeletlidisEtAl2014]. The b-value of 1.99 (weight 0.10) is unusually high and represents a conservative scenario where small earthquakes dominate, making approach to $M_{\text{max}}$ highly improbable [@MeletlidisEtAl2014].

### Mining-Induced Seismicity Considerations

The PSHA study excludes events suspected of being mining-related with magnitudes less than M4.0 to minimize the influence of induced seismicity. Mining-induced seismicity falls into two main categories: collapsing of highly stressed rock masses and shear along geological planes of weakness. The mechanism by which mining influences seismicity involves stress redistribution due to excavation, resulting in fracture initiation and movement along pre-existing planes.

Mining in the Witwatersrand Basin currently approaches depths of 4,000 meters, while in stable continental regions with thick lithosphere, seismogenic depths typically extend to 15-25 km. The Reitfontein Fault is located 43 km from the South Deep Mine site, which is substantially farther than the Pretorius Fault (18 km).

## Discussion

### Synthesis of Findings

The comprehensive analysis of the Reitfontein Fault reveals fundamental tensions between the conservative engineering assumptions employed in the South Deep PSHA and the geological, seismological, and geophysical evidence regarding fault activity and seismogenic potential.

The fault's characterization as capable of producing $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$ earthquakes derives from direct application of Wells-Coppersmith (1994) magnitude-length scaling to the 64 km mapped fault length [@WellsCoppersmith1994]. While this methodology is standard practice, it rests on critical assumptions that warrant scrutiny in the Reitfontein context:

**Seismogenic Length Assumption:** Not all mapped fault length necessarily represents seismogenic length capable of rupturing in a single earthquake. The 2.0 Ga age of the fault suggests it may comprise multiple segments with varying degrees of connectivity under the current stress regime.

**Scaling Relationship Applicability:** Stable continental region earthquakes may exhibit different scaling relationships than active tectonic region earthquakes. The Wells-Coppersmith database is dominated by active tectonic region earthquakes, potentially introducing systematic bias when applied to SCR settings.

**Cratonic Constraints:** The Mooney et al. (2012) finding that $M_{c\text{max}} = 6.0$ for cratonic interiors with seismically determined thick lithosphere [@MooneyEtAl2012] represents a physical constraint based on lithospheric rheology rather than an empirical observation subject to sampling limitations. The Kaapvaal Craton's Archean age (2.7-3.7 Ga) places it squarely within the cratonic category where this constraint applies.

### Implications for PSHA Parameterization

The absence of neotectonic evidence combined with the very low assigned slip rate (1 m/Myr) suggests that the Reitfontein Fault's seismic potential may be substantially overestimated in the current PSHA. The stark contrast with the Kango Fault - which has 200 times higher slip rates, documented paleoseismic evidence of $M_w$ 6.97-7.18 earthquakes, and observable surface expression [@KangoFaultStudy] - illustrates the range of fault activity levels within South Africa.

The paradox that Reitfontein and Kango faults are assigned similar $M_{\text{max}}$ values (7.2 vs. 6.97-7.18) despite a 200-fold difference in slip rates highlights a limitation of purely geometric scaling approaches that do not incorporate kinematic evidence. Length-based $M_{\text{max}}$ estimation provides an upper bound on potential earthquake size but does not address the probability that such earthquakes can actually occur within relevant timeframes.

### Return Period Considerations

The analysis reveals that while slip rates of 1-20 m/Myr mathematically permit return periods less than 10,000 years for events approaching $M_{\text{max}}$, multiple physical constraints suggest such events are highly improbable:

**Cratonic $M_{c\text{max}}$ Constraint:** If the $M_{c\text{max}} = 6.0$ constraint for cratonic interiors [@MooneyEtAl2012] is physically binding, then $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$ events may be impossible regardless of return period.

**Absence of Neotectonic Evidence:** Faults with slip rates $\geq$ 1 m/Myr sustained over Holocene timescales would be expected to produce observable geomorphic or structural evidence of deformation. The complete absence of such evidence suggests that if the fault is active, its slip rate is likely below 1 m/Myr.

**Historical Seismicity Context:** The largest recorded earthquake in South Africa ($M_w$ 6.2, 1969) [@Malagnini2014] occurred 56 years ago in the instrumental record. The absence of larger events despite over a century of seismograph operation suggests that $M > 6.5$ events are rare on timescales of decades to centuries.

The practical implication is that for return periods in the range of 475-2,475 years (typical for building code applications), the hazard is almost certainly dominated by smaller magnitude events ($M$ 5.5-6.5) rather than approach to $M_{\text{max}}$, particularly for the higher b-value branches. Only for very long return periods (10,000+ years) and deterministic scenario analyses does the choice of $M_{\text{max}}$ become critical.

### Regional Seismotectonic Context

The South African seismotectonic setting presents particular challenges for PSHA due to the superposition of natural tectonic seismicity, mining-induced seismicity, and the long recurrence intervals characteristic of SCR environments. The absence of a comprehensive fault catalog providing systematic slip rate and $M_{\text{max}}$ data for all South African neotectonic and paleoseismic faults creates substantial knowledge gaps.

Other documented neotectonic features in the Kaapvaal Craton include the Zebediela Fault (associated with thermal springs), the Moshaweng Fault (showing repeated extensional reactivations with recent inversion), and the Kokstad-Koffiefontein Seismicity Belt (hosting 7 hot springs). These features exhibit observable indicators of activity that are notably absent for the Reitfontein Fault, reinforcing the inference that Reitfontein represents a lower activity level than documented neotectonic structures.

The assignment of $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$ to Reitfontein must be viewed in the context that this value falls within the range of regional area source values (EZ-FRISK Drakensberg $M_{\text{max}} = 7.23$) but exceeds most zone-specific estimates (GEM ZAF ZEBED 5.28-5.93). This suggests the fault is being treated as a special case capable of hosting events substantially larger than typical background seismicity in the region.

### Paleoseismic Evidence Gap

The recommendation that "a field investigation would be required to improve understanding and reduce uncertainties associated with activity rates" highlights a critical limitation of the current analysis. Paleoseismic investigations - including trenching, dating of displaced units, or analysis of geomorphological features - could potentially provide direct evidence for or against Holocene fault activity.

The success of such investigations depends critically on the preservation of datable materials and the expression of fault displacement at the surface. For very low slip rate faults ($\leq$ 1 m/Myr), the cumulative displacement over Holocene timescales may be insufficient to create identifiable features, or such features may have been obscured by subsequent erosion or sedimentation. Research indicates that slip rates of 5-10 m/Myr would be beneath the detection limit of cosmogenic radionuclide methods [@ResearchGateDetection], suggesting that paleoseismic investigation of Reitfontein would face substantial methodological challenges.

The Kango Fault paleoseismic study [@KangoFaultStudy] provides a model for what is possible when slip rates are sufficiently high (200 m/Myr) and preservation conditions favorable. The absence of similar investigations for Reitfontein reflects both the paucity of paleoseismic research in South Africa generally and the inherent difficulty of documenting very low-rate activity.

### Mining-Induced Seismicity Considerations

The South Deep Mine's location within the Witwatersrand Basin's active mining district necessitates consideration of mining-induced seismicity. Mining operations currently approach depths of 4,000 meters, and the largest mining-related seismic event ever recorded in South Africa was magnitude 5.3 (March 9, 2005).

Mining-induced seismicity is highly unlikely to trigger rupture of the entire 64 km Reitfontein Fault. Most seismic events associated with mining are localized to the mining area and adjacent structures. The depth difference between mining operations ($\leq$ 4 km) and typical seismogenic depths for natural tectonic events in the Kaapvaal Craton (5-16 km) further suggests that any seismicity on Reitfontein would be predominantly tectonic rather than mining-induced.

The PSHA's approach of excluding events suspected of being mining-related with magnitudes less than M4.0 is appropriate for isolating the tectonic hazard. However, a comprehensive assessment would require separating local forced and triggered induced seismicity from naturally occurring tectonic seismicity, which may be challenging given the pervasive mining activity in the region.

## Conclusions

Based on comprehensive analysis of knowledge base sources and external validation against peer-reviewed literature, the following conclusions address the six research questions regarding epistemic uncertainty in PSHA parameterization for the Reitfontein Fault:

**1. Fault Activity Classification:** The Reitfontein Fault is best classified as a paleoseismic structure rather than a neotectonic fault. It lacks geological or geomorphological evidence of movement in the last 35,000 years and shows only minor present-day seismic activity. The characterization as an active fault with assigned slip rate of 1 m/Myr represents a conservative engineering assumption rather than empirically demonstrated activity.

**2. Evidence for Holocene Activity:** There is no evidence in the analyzed sources that permits affirmation of Reitfontein Fault activity in the last 35,000 years. The absence of paleoseismic investigations represents a significant data gap, but the lack of observable neotectonic features suggests that if the fault has been active in this timeframe, the activity rate is at or below detection limits of standard paleoseismic methods.
