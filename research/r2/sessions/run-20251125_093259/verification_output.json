A neotectonic fault is formally defined as one that has hosted displacement under conditions imposed by the current crustal stress regime, which in South Africa was established sometime in the last 40 to 11 million years, with active faults conventionally defined as structures known to have produced historical earthquakes or shown evidence of movement in the last 35,000 years [KB:epistemic.compile.md][WEB:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258773069_The_Seismotectonic_Model_of_Southern_Africa]. The Reitfontein Fault, at least 2.0 Ga old and having accommodated both normal and oblique reverse movement in the geological past, lacks the characteristic indicators of recent activity observed on documented neotectonic faults in South Africa such as thermal springs, fault scarps displacing young sediments, or geodetic strain accumulation [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Singh et al. (2009) specifically identified the Reitfontein Fault as one of several faults requiring reassessment to determine if still active, indicating that active classification was uncertain and did not constitute evidence of neotectonic classification [KB:epistemic.compile.md][WEB:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258773069_The_Seismotectonic_Model_of_Southern_Africa]. The fault has only been associated with minor present-day seismic activity, and other neotectonic faults in the Kaapvaal Craton such as the Zebediela, Thabazimbi, and Moshaweng faults exhibit observable geomorphic or structural evidence of recent activity that is notably absent for the Reitfontein Fault [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The characterization as a reportedly active fault with an assigned slip rate of 1 m/Myr represents a conservative engineering assumption rather than empirical evidence, and the fault retains some capacity for minor seismic reactivation under the current stress regime but lacks definitive evidence of sustained neotectonic activity [KB:epistemic.compile.md].",

The fault lacks the characteristic indicators of recent activity observed on documented neotectonic faults in South Africa, and the absence of paleoseismic investigations such as trenching, dating of displaced units, or analysis of geomorphological features represents a critical data gap that prevents definitive assessment of Holocene or Late Pleistocene activity [KB:epistemic.compile.md][WEB:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258773069_The_Seismotectonic_Model_of_Southern_Africa]. For comparative context, the Kango Fault in the southern Cape Fold Belt provides the most robust paleoseismic evidence for large prehistoric earthquakes in South Africa, with paleoseismic trench investigation finding a 2.0 plus or minus 0.06 m free-standing fault scarp with moment magnitude estimated between $M_w$ 6.97 plus or minus 0.01 and 7.18 plus or minus 0.01, and this fault has measured slip rates on the order of 200 m/Myr, which is 200 times higher than Reitfontein's assigned rate [KB:epistemic.compile.md][DOI:10.2113/gssajg.119.3.569].

The absence of evidence for recent activity does not definitively exclude the possibility of rare, episodic large earthquakes characteristic of SCR settings, but the very low assigned slip rate of 1 m/Myr and lack of observable neotectonic features suggest that if the fault has been active in the last 35,000 years, the activity rate would be at or below detection limits of standard paleoseismic methods [KB:epistemic.compile.md].",

However, critical caveats apply because not all mapped fault length necessarily represents seismogenic length capable of rupturing in a single earthquake, and stable continental region earthquakes may exhibit different scaling relationships than active tectonic region earthquakes for which the Wells-Coppersmith database is dominated [KB:epistemic.compile.md][WEB:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349168103_Scaling_relations_between_seismic_moment_and_rupture_area_of_earthquakes_in_stable_continental_regions]. The $M_{\\text{max}} = 7.2$ represents an unusually high value for the South African stable continental region, where current PSHA models assign $M_{\\text{max}}$ values ranging from 5.3-6.3 for most regional zones, though the EZ-FRISK Africa model assigns $M_{\\text{max}}$ values of 7.23 to the Drakensberg zone and 7.0 to the Kaapvaal zone, covering areas of 820,725 square kilometers and 281,858 square kilometers respectively [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Research on cratonic lithosphere indicates that for cratonic interiors with seismically determined thick lithosphere, the maximum moment magnitude found in the earthquake catalog is $M_{c\\text{max}} = 6.0$, and no earthquakes with $M_w > 6$ have occurred above mantle lithosphere with $\\delta V_S > 3.5$ percent, a characteristic of cold cratonic regions [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The largest recorded earthquake in South Africa was the Ceres event of September 29, 1969, with magnitude $M_w$ 6.2, representing a 1.0 magnitude unit difference or 32 times difference in seismic moment release from the assigned $M_{\\text{max}} = 7.2$ [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Paleoseismic evidence from stable continental regions globally indicates that prehistoric earthquakes may have greatly exceeded maximum observed instrumental magnitudes, with Australian SCR faults yielding $M_{\\text{max}}$ estimates of 7.0-7.5 plus or minus 0.2 based on multiple documented paleoearthquakes, and the Kango Fault paleoseismic evidence in South Africa demonstrates that $M_w$ 6.97-7.18 events are physically possible [KB:epistemic.compile.md][DOI:10.2113/gssajg.119.3.569]. Logic tree weights for $M_{\\text{max}} = 7.2$ should reflect substantial epistemic uncertainty given the absence of neotectonic evidence, the cratonic constraints suggesting $M_{c\\text{max}} = 6.0$, the 200-fold difference in slip rates compared to the Kango Fault which produced similar magnitude events, and the fact that length-based $M_{\\text{max}}$ estimation provides an upper bound on potential earthquake size but does not address the probability that such earthquakes can actually occur within relevant timeframes [KB:epistemic.compile.md].",

      "paragraph": "No slip rate has been published for the Reitfontein Fault, and the assigned 1 m/Myr value is a conservative engineering assumption with no empirical slip-rate evidence, representing a low uplift rate assigned for bedrock faults that do not show evidence of movement in the last 10 million years but are included due to favorable orientation [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Research indicates that fault slip rates in the order of 5-10 m/Myr in stable continental regions would be beneath the detection limit of cosmogenic radionuclide methods, suggesting that 1 m/Myr represents an exceptionally slow slip rate at or below detection limits for many paleoseismic methods in SCR settings [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Some of the more active faults in South Africa have slip rates on the order of 200 m/Myr such as the Kango Fault, which is 200 times higher than Reitfontein's assigned rate yet produces similar maximum magnitudes, while the Pretorius Fault is also assigned a slip rate of 1 m/Myr in the absence of published estimates [KB:epistemic.compile.md][DOI:10.2113/gssajg.119.3.569]. The absence of quantified slip-rate data reflects the general paucity of paleoseismic studies on South African faults, and within intraplate environments, deformation is transient, occurring in discrete episodes separated by long hiatuses, with faults in stable continental regions exhibiting episodic behavior with recurrence intervals of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years between ground-rupturing events [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Logic tree development for slip rate should incorporate a range reflecting this epistemic uncertainty, with lower branches weighted more heavily given the absence of observable neotectonic features that would be expected from sustained slip at rates of 1 m/Myr or higher over Holocene timescales, the very slow deformation rates characteristic of cratonic environments that make identifying paleoseismic evidence particularly challenging, and the fact that if the fault is active, the slip rate is likely below 1 m/Myr based on the complete absence of geomorphic evidence [KB:epistemic.compile.md][WEB:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258773069_The_Seismotectonic_Model_of_Southern_Africa]. A recommended approach would incorporate slip rate branches spanning 0.1 m/Myr to 10 m/Myr with highest weight on the 0.1-1 m/Myr range, acknowledging that field investigations would be required to improve understanding and reduce uncertainties associated with activity rates, and that paleoseismic investigation of Reitfontein would face substantial methodological challenges given slip rates of 5-10 m/Myr would be beneath detection limits [KB:epistemic.compile.md].",

The $M_{\\text{max}}$ value primarily influences long-return-period hazard estimates of 10,000 years and beyond and deterministic scenario analyses, while disaggregation of the hazard shows that the majority of hazard comes from lower magnitudes for moderate return periods, and $M_{\\text{max}}$ does not critically affect ground motion recurrence estimates for return periods up to hundreds of years, especially when the b-value is high [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. For the Reitfontein Fault with $M_{\\text{max}} = 7.2$, the minimum magnitude $M_{\\text{min}} = 5.7$, and three different b-values are employed: 1.35 with weight 0.30, 1.10 with weight 0.60, and 1.99 with weight 0.10, where a lower b-value means that the ratio of large to small earthquakes is higher, increasing the probability of larger magnitude events [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. However, critical caveats fundamentally constrain the probability of $M_{\\text{max}} = 7.2$ events in short return periods, including the complete lack of geological or geomorphological evidence for recent activity that contradicts the slip rates of 1 m/Myr or greater that would produce observable surface deformation over Holocene timescales, the cratonic constraint of $M_{c\\text{max}} = 6.0$ for cratonic interiors suggesting that $M_{\\text{max}} = 7.2$ events may not be physically realizable regardless of return period, and the episodic behavior of SCR faults with recurrence intervals potentially exceeding 100,000 years making deterministic recurrence calculations highly uncertain [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The largest mining-related seismic event ever to occur in South Africa registered magnitude 5.3 on March 9, 2005, and mining-induced seismicity is highly unlikely to trigger rupture of the entire 64 km Reitfontein Fault, with most seismic events associated with mining localized to the mining area and adjacent structures [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. While slip rates of 1-20 m/Myr mathematically permit return periods less than 10,000 years for events approaching $M_{\\text{max}}$, multiple physical constraints suggest such events are highly improbable, and for return periods in the range of 475-2,475 years typical for building code applications, the hazard is almost certainly dominated by smaller magnitude events in the range of $M$ 5.5-6.5 rather than approach to $M_{\\text{max}}$, particularly for the higher b-value branches [KB:epistemic.compile.md].",

For the Reitfontein Fault, three different b-values are employed: 1.35 with weight 0.30, 1.10 with weight 0.60, and 1.99 with weight 0.10, where the dominant weight of 0.60 on the intermediate b-value of 1.10 suggests this is the most representative value for the Reitfontein Fault [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The EZ-FRISK zones have b-values of 1.04 for Drakensberg and 1.06 for Kaapvaal, which are consistent with the global average for tectonic earthquakes, while the Reitfontein Fault's central b-value of 1.10 is slightly higher than these regional values, and the weighted b-value of 1.35 is substantially higher [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Global and regional surveys show empirically determined b-values are remarkably stable, generally limited to values of $1 \\pm 0.2$ (0.8 to 1.2), and the Reitfontein values of 1.35 and 1.10 fall within or near this typical range, while the b-value of 1.99 with weight 0.10 is unusually high and represents a conservative scenario where small earthquakes dominate, making approach to $M_{\\text{max}}$ highly improbable [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The PSHA study excludes events suspected of being mining-related with magnitudes less than M4.0 to minimize the influence of induced seismicity, and mining-induced seismicity falls into two main categories: collapsing of highly stressed rock masses and shear along geological planes of weakness, with the mechanism involving stress redistribution due to excavation resulting in fracture initiation and movement along pre-existing planes [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Mining in the Witwatersrand Basin currently approaches depths of 4,000 meters, while in stable continental regions with thick lithosphere, seismogenic depths typically extend to 15-25 km, and the Reitfontein Fault is located 43 km from the South Deep Mine site [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The current b-value logic tree appropriately captures epistemic uncertainty through three branches spanning the range from slightly below the global average (1.10) to substantially above it (1.35, 1.99), with the highest weight on the intermediate value consistent with regional b-values for the Kaapvaal and Drakensberg zones, though consideration could be given to including a branch at b equals 1.0 or slightly below to reflect the possibility of a b-value closer to the global tectonic average [KB:epistemic.compile.md][WEB:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258773069_The_Seismotectonic_Model_of_Southern_Africa].",

Paleoseismic evidence from stable continental regions globally indicates that prehistoric earthquakes may have greatly exceeded maximum observed instrumental magnitudes, with Australian stable continental region faults yielding $M_{\\text{max}}$ estimates of $7.0-7.5 \\pm 0.2$ based on multiple documented paleoearthquakes, representing arguably the richest Late Neogene to Quaternary faulting record in stable continental region crust anywhere in the world [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The Kango Fault paleoseismic evidence in South Africa demonstrates that $M_w$ 6.97 to 7.18 events are physically possible in the South African tectonic setting [KB:epistemic.compile.md].",

The dominant weight of 0.60 on the intermediate b-value of 1.10 suggests this is the most representative value for the Reitfontein Fault [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The EZ-FRISK zones have b-values of 1.04 for Drakensberg and 1.06 for Kaapvaal, which are regional b-values consistent with the global average for tectonic earthquakes [KB:epistemic.compile.md].

      "paragraph": "The Reitfontein Fault is best classified as a paleoseismic structure rather than a neotectonic fault based on multiple lines of evidence. The fault is at least 2.0 Ga old and has accommodated both normal and oblique reverse movement in the geological past within the Kaapvaal Craton, an Archean cratonic structure formed between 2.7 and 3.7 Ga [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. A neotectonic fault is formally defined as one that has hosted displacement under conditions imposed by the current crustal stress regime, established in South Africa sometime in the last 40 to 11 million years, while active faults are conventionally defined as structures known to have produced historical earthquakes or shown evidence of movement in the last 35,000 years [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. There is no known geological or geomorphological evidence to suggest neotectonic activity on the Reitfontein Fault, with the fault having only been associated with minor present-day seismic activity [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Singh et al. (2009) specifically identified the Reitfontein Fault as one of several faults requiring reassessment to determine if still active, indicating that active classification was uncertain even at the time of that synthesis [KB:epistemic.compile.md][WEB:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258773069_The_Seismotectonic_Model_of_Southern_Africa]. Other neotectonic faults in the Kaapvaal Craton, including the Zebediela, Thabazimbi, and Moshaweng faults, display observable geomorphic or structural evidence of recent activity such as thermal springs or repeated extensional reactivations that are notably absent for the Reitfontein Fault [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The characterization as a reportedly active fault with an assigned slip rate of 1 m/Myr represents a conservative engineering assumption rather than empirical evidence, and the fault is best understood as a paleoseismic structure that may retain some capacity for minor seismic reactivation under the current stress regime but lacks definitive evidence of sustained neotectonic activity [KB:epistemic.compile.md].",

The fault lacks the characteristic indicators of recent activity observed on documented neotectonic faults in South Africa, such as thermal springs, fault scarps displacing young sediments, or geodetic strain accumulation [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. A field investigation would be required to improve understanding and reduce uncertainties associated with activity rates, with paleoseismic investigations potentially including trenching, dating of displaced units, or analysis of geomorphological features, though the absence of such investigations represents a critical data gap that prevents definitive assessment of Holocene or Late Pleistocene activity [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. For comparative context, the Kango Fault in the southern Cape Fold Belt provides the most robust paleoseismic evidence for large prehistoric earthquakes in South Africa, with paleoseismic trench investigation finding a $2.0 \\pm 0.06$ m free-standing fault scarp with moment magnitude estimated between $M_w$ $6.97 \\pm 0.01$ and $7.18 \\pm 0.01$, and measured slip rates on the order of 200 m/Myr, which is 200 times higher than Reitfontein's assigned rate [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. In stable continental regions, faults may exhibit episodic behavior with recurrence intervals of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years between ground-rupturing events, and paleoseismic studies emphasize the danger of over-reliance on instrumental catalogs in regions with recurrence intervals of 10,000-100,000+ years [KB:epistemic.compile.md][WEB:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281460177_Paleoseismicity_of_Two_Historically_Quiescent_Faults_in_Australia_Implications_for_Fault_Behavior_in_Stable_Continental_Regions]. The absence of evidence for recent activity does not definitively exclude the possibility of rare, episodic large earthquakes characteristic of stable continental region settings, but neither does it provide positive evidence for such activity, and the very low assigned slip rate (1 m/Myr) combined with lack of observable neotectonic features suggests that if the fault has been active in the last 35,000 years, the activity rate would be at or below detection limits of standard paleoseismic methods [KB:epistemic.compile.md].",

Critical caveats apply to this calculation: not all mapped fault length necessarily represents seismogenic length capable of rupturing in a single earthquake, stable continental region earthquakes may exhibit different scaling relationships than active tectonic region earthquakes, and the 64 km rupture length assumption is justified as a conservative estimate based on mapped extent, though actual seismogenic length may be considerably shorter [KB:epistemic.compile.md][WEB:https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/8755293020988024].

For the Reitfontein Fault, three different b-values are employed: 1.35 (weighted 0.30), 1.10 (weighted 0.60), and 1.99 (weighted 0.10), with the dominant weight of 0.60 on the intermediate b-value of 1.10 suggesting this is the most representative value for the Reitfontein Fault [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The lower b-value of 1.35 with weight 0.30 increases the relative probability of larger magnitude events, while the high b-value of 1.99 with low weight of 0.10 represents a scenario where earthquake activity is dominated by smaller events [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The EZ-FRISK zones have b-values of 1.04 (Drakensberg) and 1.06 (Kaapvaal), which are consistent with the global average for tectonic earthquakes, while the Reitfontein Fault's central b-value of 1.10 is slightly higher than these regional values, and the weighted b-value of 1.35 is substantially higher [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Global and regional surveys show empirically determined b-values are remarkably stable, generally limited to values of $1 \\pm 0.2$ (i.e., 0.8 to 1.2), with the Reitfontein values of 1.35 and 1.10 falling within or near this typical range, while the b-value of 1.99 (weight 0.10) is unusually high and represents a conservative scenario where small earthquakes dominate, making approach to $M_{\\text{max}}$ highly improbable [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The PSHA study excludes events suspected of being mining-related with magnitudes less than M4.0 to minimize the influence of induced seismicity, with mining-induced seismicity falling into two main categories: collapsing of highly stressed rock masses and shear along geological planes of weakness [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Mining in the Witwatersrand Basin currently approaches depths of 4,000 meters, while in stable continental regions with thick lithosphere, seismogenic depths typically extend to 15-25 km, and the Reitfontein Fault is located 43 km from the South Deep Mine site [KB:epistemic.compile.md].",

The middle branch at $M_{\\text{max}} = 7.0$ with weight 0.45 should receive the highest weight as it represents the EZ-FRISK Kaapvaal zone value of 7.0 for the 281,858 square kilometer regional zone in which the fault is situated, falls within the range of similar magnitude estimates for the Kango Fault paleoseismic events of $M_w$ 6.97-7.18 that demonstrate such events are physically possible in South Africa, and represents a compromise between the cratonic physical constraints and the geometric scaling relationships [KB:epistemic.compile.md][DOI:10.2113/gssajg.119.3.569]. The upper branch at $M_{\\text{max}} = 7.2$ with weight 0.20 should retain the current Wells and Coppersmith (1994) derived value to preserve the conservative engineering assumption based on the 64 km mapped fault length, acknowledging that while this magnitude represents a 1.0 magnitude unit or 32-fold seismic moment increase above the largest recorded South African earthquake of $M_w$ 6.2, paleoseismic evidence from Australian SCR faults demonstrates that $M_{\\text{max}}$ estimates of 7.0-7.5 plus or minus 0.2 are physically plausible in stable continental regions [KB:epistemic.compile.md][WEB:https://www.resolutionmineeis.us/sites/default/files/references/wells-coppersmith-1994.pdf].

The lowest branch at 0.01 m/Myr with weight 0.25 should represent the scenario that the fault is essentially quiescent under the current stress regime with slip rate well below detection limits, consistent with the complete absence of geological or geomorphological evidence of neotectonic activity and the characterization as a paleoseismic structure with only minor present-day seismic activity [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. A second branch at 0.1 m/Myr with weight 0.35 should receive substantial weight to reflect slip rates at the lower detection limit of most paleoseismic methods, acknowledging that research indicates fault slip rates of 5-10 m/Myr in stable continental regions would be beneath the detection limit of cosmogenic radionuclide methods, and thus 0.1 m/Myr represents activity too slow to be observable through standard paleoseismic investigation techniques [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The third branch at 1.0 m/Myr with weight 0.30 should retain the current assigned value as a conservative engineering assumption based on favorable orientation for bedrock faults that do not show evidence of movement in the last 10 million years, representing the upper range of credible slip rates given the absence of observable surface deformation that would be expected from sustained slip at this rate over Holocene timescales [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. A fourth branch at 5.0 m/Myr with weight 0.10 should provide coverage of higher slip rate scenarios to maintain conservatism in the engineering assessment, though this branch should carry lower weight given it approaches the detection limits for paleoseismic methods and would be expected to produce observable geomorphic features over Late Pleistocene to Holocene timescales if sustained [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Implementation of this slip rate logic tree should be coupled with explicit recognition that the three-order-of-magnitude uncertainty range from 0.01 to 5.0 m/Myr fundamentally reflects the absence of empirical data, that field investigations including paleoseismic trenching would be required to meaningfully constrain this parameter though such investigations face substantial methodological challenges at very low slip rates, and that the paradox of assigning similar $M_{\\text{max}}$ values to the Reitfontein Fault (7.2) and Kango Fault (6.97-7.18) despite a 200-fold difference in slip rates highlights a fundamental limitation of purely geometric scaling approaches that do not incorporate kinematic evidence regarding the probability that maximum magnitude earthquakes can occur within relevant assessment timeframes [KB:epistemic.compile.md][DOI:10.2113/gssajg.119.3.569][WEB:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258773069_The_Seismotectonic_Model_of_Southern_Africa].",

The rationale for increasing the weight on the lower b-value of 1.35 is that stable continental region seismicity in cratonic settings may exhibit relatively higher rates of larger magnitude events compared to smaller events, particularly when compared to active tectonic regions, and the episodic nature of stable continental region faulting with long recurrence intervals and discrete rupture episodes favors a lower b-value representation [KB:epistemic.compile.md].

Given that no slip rate has been published for the Reitfontein Fault and the 1 m/Myr value is acknowledged as a conservative engineering assumption rather than empirical evidence, a three-branch slip rate logic tree is recommended: a low branch with 0.5 m/Myr assigned weight 0.30 reflecting the possibility that activity rates are below current detection thresholds, a central branch with 1.0 m/Myr assigned weight 0.50 reflecting the current conservative baseline assumption, and a high branch with 2.0 m/Myr assigned weight 0.20 allowing for the possibility of episodic activity that might produce higher time-averaged slip rates over longer intervals [KB:epistemic.compile.md][WEB:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00024-022-03143-4]. The rationale for this distribution is that the absence of geological or geomorphological evidence for neotectonic activity suggests that if the fault is active, its slip rate is likely at the lower end of the range or below the assigned 1 m/Myr value [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Research indicates that fault slip rates in the order of 5 to 10 m/Myr in stable continental regions would be beneath the detection limit of cosmogenic radionuclide methods, and the Reitfontein assigned rate of 1 m/Myr is already at this threshold [KB:epistemic.compile.md].

(2012) cratonic interior catalog maximum and the largest recorded South African earthquake ($M_w$ 6.2 Ceres, 1969), assigned a weight of 0.25 to reflect the physical constraint that no earthquakes with $M_w > 6$ have occurred above mantle lithosphere with $\\delta V_S > 3.5\\%$ characteristic of the Kaapvaal Craton [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. This weighting scheme (0.25, 0.50, 0.25) distributes epistemic uncertainty across a plausible magnitude range while centering probability on an intermediate value that acknowledges both fault geometry and cratonic constraints, and follows established PSHA practice of assigning highest weight to central estimates with symmetric lower weights to uncertainty bounds [WEB:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00024-022-03143-4].",

The KB:epistemic.compile.md supports the physical basis for each branch: the 7.2 value from Wells-Coppersmith 64 km scaling, the absence of neotectonic evidence, the cratonic constraint of $M_{c\\text{max}} = 6.0$ from Mooney et al.

However, the specific weight values (0.25, 0.50, 0.25) and the intermediate magnitude of 6.5 represent a proposed recommendation rather than empirically derived values, though they follow the established PSHA practice of symmetric weights around a central estimate as noted in the logic tree literature.

A revised weighting scheme is recommended to better reflect empirical constraints and standard practice in PSHA. The central b-value of 1.10 should be retained with weight 0.50, reduced from the current 0.60, as this value is slightly above the regional EZ-FRISK values (1.04 Drakensberg, 1.06 Kaapvaal) and close to the global average for tectonic earthquakes, representing the most likely characterization [KB:epistemic.compile.md][WEB:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00024-022-03143-4]. The lower b-value branch should be adjusted to b = 1.00 with weight 0.30, replacing the current 1.35 value, to align with regional values and represent a scenario where larger magnitude events have increased relative probability while remaining within the empirically observed range of $1 \\pm 0.2$ for stable regions [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The upper b-value branch should be set to b = 1.30 with weight 0.20, replacing the current 1.99 value, to represent the conservative scenario where smaller events dominate while avoiding the physically implausible extreme of b = 1.99 which is far outside typical empirical ranges [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. This revised three-branch structure (b = 1.00/0.30, b = 1.10/0.50, b = 1.30/0.20) maintains coverage of the plausible b-value range while concentrating weight on values consistent with global and regional observations, follows the common PSHA practice of assigning weights of 0.2, 0.6, and 0.2 to (b minus sigma, mean b-value, b plus sigma) but adapted to reflect the specific epistemic uncertainty context of the Reitfontein Fault [WEB:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229025012_Testing_the_b-value_variability_in_Italy_and_its_influence_on_Italian_PSHA]. The a-value parameter in the Gutenberg-Richter relationship should be calibrated to match observed seismicity rates after filtering mining-related events with magnitudes less than M4.0, with epistemic uncertainty in the a-value captured through a minimum two-branch logic tree representing upper and lower bounds of the 95 percent confidence interval from catalog-based maximum likelihood estimation [KB:epistemic.compile.md].",

The KB:epistemic.compile.md provides the current b-value implementation (1.35/0.30, 1.10/0.60, 1.99/0.10), regional EZ-FRISK values (1.04, 1.06), and the empirical stability range ($1 \\pm 0.2$, i.e., 0.8-1.2).

The rationale for each adjustment is grounded in cited evidence (alignment with regional values, staying within empirical ranges, avoiding extreme values), but the exact numerical choices reflect expert judgment rather than direct measurement. The a-value recommendation (two-branch logic tree, 95% confidence interval) is a methodological proposal consistent with PSHA practice but not specifically cited from the sources.

      "paragraph": "The assigned slip rate of 1 m/Myr for the Reitfontein Fault represents a conservative engineering assumption in the complete absence of published empirical measurements, and this value is at or below the detection limits of standard paleoseismic methods including cosmogenic radionuclide dating, which would be beneath detection for slip rates in the order of 5-10 m/Myr [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Given the fundamental epistemic uncertainty in slip rate, a single-value assumption is inappropriate, and a three-branch logic tree structure is recommended to span the plausible range. The lower branch should adopt 0.1 m/Myr with weight 0.20, representing the scenario where the fault exhibits only rare episodic reactivation with recurrence intervals exceeding 100,000 years, consistent with the complete absence of observable neotectonic features and the fact that cratonic SCR faults commonly experience quiescent intervals of 100,000 years or more [KB:epistemic.compile.md][WEB:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281460177_Paleoseismicity_of_Two_Historically_Quiescent_Faults_in_Australia_Implications_for_Fault_Behavior_in_Stable_Continental_Regions]. The central branch should maintain 1.0 m/Myr with weight 0.60, preserving the current baseline assumption and reflecting that this value is the conventional assignment for bedrock faults that do not show evidence of movement in the last 10 million years but are included due to favorable orientation [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The upper branch should implement 5.0 m/Myr with weight 0.20, representing a more active scenario while remaining well below the 200 m/Myr slip rate of documented active faults like Kango, and acknowledging that detection of slip rates below 5-10 m/Myr is methodologically challenging [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. This slip rate logic tree (0.1/0.20, 1.0/0.60, 5.0/0.20) should be cross-correlated with the $M_{\\text{max}}$ logic tree such that higher slip rates pair with higher maximum magnitudes, implementing physical consistency where rapid strain accumulation supports larger seismic moment release. For the lowest slip rate branch (0.1 m/Myr), pair with $M_{\\text{max}} = 6.0$; for the central slip rate (1.0 m/Myr), pair with $M_{\\text{max}} = 6.5$; and for the upper slip rate (5.0 m/Myr), pair with $M_{\\text{max}} = 7.2$, thereby ensuring that the combination of kinematic and geometric constraints remains physically plausible across the logic tree branches [WEB:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00024-022-03143-4].",

The KB:epistemic.compile.md supports several foundational claims: the 1 m/Myr value is a conservative engineering assumption lacking empirical measurements, it is at or below detection limits, 5-10 m/Myr is beneath cosmogenic radionuclide detection, the Kango Fault has 200 m/Myr, 1 m/Myr is conventionally assigned to bedrock faults without 10 Ma movement evidence, cratonic faults experience quiescent intervals of 100,000+ years, and there is complete absence of neotectonic features. The external web source on Australian SCR paleoseismicity corroborates the episodic reactivation and long quiescent intervals.
