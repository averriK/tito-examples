# Reitfontein Fault Epistemic Uncertainty Analysis

## Fault Classification

The Reitfontein Fault is classified as a paleoseismic structure rather than a neotectonic fault based on comprehensive geological, seismological, and geophysical evidence [@EpistemicCompile]. Neotectonic faults are formally defined as structures that have hosted displacement under conditions imposed by the current crustal stress regime, established in South Africa within the last 40 to 11 million years. Active faults are conventionally defined as structures that have produced historical earthquakes or shown evidence of movement in the last 35,000 years [@EpistemicCompile][@Singh2009][@USGS].

The Reitfontein Fault is at least 2.0 Ga old and accommodated both normal and oblique reverse movement in the geological past within the Kaapvaal Craton, an Archean cratonic structure formed between 2.7 and 3.7 Ga [@EpistemicCompile]. The fault lacks characteristic indicators of recent activity observed on documented neotectonic faults in South Africa, including thermal springs, fault scarps displacing young sediments, and geodetic strain accumulation [@EpistemicCompile]. Singh et al. (2009) specifically identified the Reitfontein Fault as requiring reassessment to determine if still active, indicating that active classification was uncertain [@EpistemicCompile][@Singh2009].

Other neotectonic faults in the Kaapvaal Craton, such as the Zebediela, Thabazimbi, and Moshaweng faults, exhibit observable geomorphic or structural evidence of recent activity that is notably absent for the Reitfontein Fault [@EpistemicCompile]. The characterization as an active fault with assigned slip rate of 1 m/Myr represents a conservative engineering assumption rather than empirical evidence, and the fault retains some capacity for minor seismic reactivation under the current stress regime but lacks definitive evidence of sustained neotectonic activity [@EpistemicCompile].

## Evidence for Activity in the Last 35,000 Years

No geological or geomorphological evidence suggests neotectonic activity on the Reitfontein Fault within the last 35,000 years [@EpistemicCompile]. The fault lacks documented surface ruptures, displaced young sediments, geomorphic expression of recent faulting, and other indicators that would satisfy the conventional definition of an active fault [@EpistemicCompile]. The absence of paleoseismic investigations such as trenching, dating of displaced units, or analysis of geomorphological features represents a critical data gap that prevents definitive assessment of Holocene or Late Pleistocene activity [@EpistemicCompile][@Singh2009].

For comparative context, the Kango Fault in the southern Cape Fold Belt provides the most robust paleoseismic evidence for large prehistoric earthquakes in South Africa. Paleoseismic trench investigation found a $2.0 \pm 0.06$ m free-standing fault scarp with moment magnitude estimated between $M_w$ $6.97 \pm 0.01$ and $7.18 \pm 0.01$. The Kango Fault has measured slip rates on the order of 200 m/Myr, which is 200 times higher than Reitfontein's assigned rate [@EpistemicCompile][@Viola2016]. Faults with demonstrable recent activity in South Africa exhibit substantially higher slip rates and observable surface expression.

Research indicates that fault slip rates on the order of 5-10 m/Myr in stable continental regions would be beneath the detection limit of cosmogenic radionuclide methods, suggesting that the assigned 1 m/Myr represents an exceptionally slow rate at or below detection limits for many paleoseismic methods [@EpistemicCompile].

In stable continental regions, faults exhibit episodic behavior with recurrence intervals of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years between ground-rupturing events [@EpistemicCompile][@Clark2012]. Cratonic faults typically have long-term behavior characterized by episodes of activity separated by quiescent intervals of at least 10,000 and commonly 100,000 years or more. The long-term slip rate on cratonic stable continental region faults is extremely low, making geomorphic expression subtle and scarps difficult to detect due to poor preservation [@Clark2012]. Paleoseismic studies emphasize the danger of over-reliance on instrumental catalogs in regions with such long recurrence intervals [@EpistemicCompile].

The absence of evidence for recent activity does not definitively exclude the possibility of rare, episodic large earthquakes characteristic of stable continental region settings, but the very low assigned slip rate combined with lack of observable neotectonic features suggests that if the fault has been active in the last 35,000 years, the activity rate would be at or below detection limits of standard paleoseismic methods [@EpistemicCompile].

## Maximum Magnitude Assessment

The $M_{\text{max}}$ of 7.2 for the Reitfontein Fault has been determined using the Wells and Coppersmith (1994) relationship for a 64 km fault length [@EpistemicCompile][@WellsCoppersmith1994]. Log-linear regressions between earthquake magnitude and surface rupture length show strong correlations with standard deviations of 0.25 to 0.35 magnitude units, implying that for a 64 km fault, magnitudes could reasonably range from approximately 6.85 to 7.55 based solely on scaling relationship uncertainty [@EpistemicCompile][@WellsCoppersmith1994].

Critical caveats apply to this calculation. Not all mapped fault length necessarily represents seismogenic length capable of rupturing in a single earthquake. Stable continental region earthquakes may exhibit different scaling relationships than active tectonic region earthquakes for which the Wells-Coppersmith database is dominated [@EpistemicCompile][@Allen2017][@Leonard2020]. The 64 km rupture length assumption is justified as a conservative estimate based on mapped extent, though actual seismogenic length may be considerably shorter [@EpistemicCompile][@Leonard2020].

The $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$ represents an unusually high value for the South African stable continental region. Current probabilistic seismic hazard assessment models assign $M_{\text{max}}$ values ranging from 5.3 to 6.3 for most regional zones [@EpistemicCompile]. The EZ-FRISK Africa model assigns $M_{\text{max}}$ values of 7.23 to the Drakensberg zone (820,725 km$^2$) and 7.0 to the Kaapvaal zone (281,858 km$^2$) [@EpistemicCompile].

Research on cratonic lithosphere indicates that for cratonic interiors with seismically determined thick lithosphere, the catalog maximum moment magnitude is $M_{c\text{max}} = 6.0$, and no earthquakes with $M_w > 6$ have occurred above mantle lithosphere with $\delta V_S > 3.5\%$, a characteristic of cold cratonic regions [@EpistemicCompile]. The largest recorded earthquake in South Africa was the Ceres event of September 29, 1969, with magnitude $M_w$ 6.2, representing a 1.0 magnitude unit difference equivalent to 32 times the seismic moment release from the assigned $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$ [@EpistemicCompile][@Malagnini2019].

Paleoseismic evidence from stable continental regions globally indicates that prehistoric earthquakes may have greatly exceeded maximum observed instrumental magnitudes. Australian stable continental region faults yield $M_{\text{max}}$ estimates of $7.0-7.5 \pm 0.2$ based on multiple documented paleoearthquakes, representing arguably the richest Late Neogene to Quaternary faulting record in stable continental region crust anywhere in the world [@EpistemicCompile]. The Kango Fault paleoseismic evidence demonstrates that $M_w$ 6.97-7.18 events are physically possible in the South African tectonic setting [@EpistemicCompile][@Viola2016].

Logic tree weights for $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$ should reflect substantial epistemic uncertainty given the absence of neotectonic evidence, the cratonic constraints suggesting $M_{c\text{max}} = 6.0$, the 200-fold difference in slip rates compared to the Kango Fault which produced similar magnitude events, and the fact that length-based $M_{\text{max}}$ estimation provides an upper bound on potential earthquake size but does not address the probability that such earthquakes can occur within relevant timeframes [@EpistemicCompile].

## Slip Rate Uncertainty

No slip rate has been published for the Reitfontein Fault. The assigned value of 1 m/Myr represents a conservative engineering assumption rather than empirical measurement [@EpistemicCompile]. When slip rates are not quantified, they are estimated based on all other available data. For bedrock faults that do not show evidence of movement in the last 10 million years but are included due to favorable orientation, a low uplift rate of 1 m/Myr is assigned [@EpistemicCompile].

Some of the more active faults in South Africa have slip rates on the order of 200 m/Myr, such as the Kango Fault, which is 200 times higher than Reitfontein's assigned rate yet produces similar maximum magnitudes [@EpistemicCompile][@Viola2016]. The Pretorius Fault is also assigned a slip rate of 1 m/Myr in the absence of published estimates, placing both faults at the lower end of the slip-rate spectrum for active structures in South Africa [@EpistemicCompile].

The absence of quantified slip-rate data reflects the general paucity of paleoseismic studies on South African faults [@EpistemicCompile]. Within intraplate environments, deformation is transient, occurring in discrete episodes separated by long hiatuses. In stable continental regions with thick lithosphere, seismogenic depths typically extend to 15 to 25 km, and the Kaapvaal Craton seismogenic structure has documented activity at 5 to 16 km depth [@EpistemicCompile].

Logic tree development for slip rate should incorporate a range reflecting this epistemic uncertainty, with lower branches weighted more heavily given the absence of observable neotectonic features that would be expected from sustained slip at rates of 1 m/Myr or higher over Holocene timescales. A recommended approach would incorporate slip rate branches spanning 0.1 m/Myr to 10 m/Myr with highest weight on the 0.1-1 m/Myr range, acknowledging that field investigations would be required to improve understanding and that paleoseismic investigation of Reitfontein would face substantial methodological challenges [@EpistemicCompile][@Singh2009].

## Return Period Considerations

To assess whether the slip rate range permits seismic movements in return periods less than 1/10,000 years (annual probability $> 10^{-4}$), the relationship between slip rate, earthquake magnitude, and recurrence interval must be considered using the characteristic earthquake model and Gutenberg-Richter recurrence relationship [@EpistemicCompile].

The $M_{\text{max}}$ value primarily influences long-return-period hazard estimates of 10,000 years and beyond and deterministic scenario analyses. Disaggregation of the hazard shows that the majority of hazard comes from lower magnitudes for moderate return periods [@EpistemicCompile]. The $M_{\text{max}}$ does not critically affect ground motion recurrence estimates for return periods up to hundreds of years, especially when the b-value is high [@EpistemicCompile].

For the Reitfontein Fault with $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$, the minimum magnitude $M_{\text{min}} = 5.7$. For $M_{\text{max}}$ between 6.5 and 7.4, $M_{\text{min}} = M_{\text{max}} - 1.5$, yielding a range of 5.0 to 5.9 [@EpistemicCompile].

Critical caveats fundamentally constrain the probability of $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$ events in short return periods. The complete lack of geological or geomorphological evidence for recent activity contradicts slip rates of 1 m/Myr or greater that would produce observable surface deformation over Holocene timescales [@EpistemicCompile]. The cratonic constraint of $M_{c\text{max}} = 6.0$ for cratonic interiors suggests that $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$ events may not be physically realizable regardless of return period [@EpistemicCompile]. The episodic behavior of stable continental region faults with recurrence intervals potentially exceeding 100,000 years makes deterministic recurrence calculations highly uncertain [@EpistemicCompile][@Clark2012].

The Kango Fault paleoseismic evidence shows an early Holocene earthquake approximately 10,000 to 12,000 years ago despite having slip rates 200 times higher than Reitfontein [@EpistemicCompile].

Mining-induced seismicity is highly unlikely to trigger rupture of the entire 64 km Reitfontein Fault. The largest mining-related seismic event ever to occur in South Africa registered magnitude 5.3 on March 9, 2005. Most seismic events associated with mining are localized to the mining area and adjacent structures [@EpistemicCompile]. Mining in the Witwatersrand Basin currently approaches depths of 4,000 meters, while seismogenic depths typically extend to 15-25 km in stable continental regions with thick lithosphere. The Reitfontein Fault is located 43 km from the South Deep Mine site [@EpistemicCompile].

While slip rates of 1-20 m/Myr mathematically permit return periods less than 10,000 years for events approaching $M_{\text{max}}$, multiple physical constraints suggest such events are highly improbable. For return periods in the range of 475-2,475 years typical for building code applications, the hazard is almost certainly dominated by smaller magnitude events in the range of $M$ 5.5-6.5 rather than approach to $M_{\text{max}}$, particularly for the higher b-value branches [@EpistemicCompile].

## Gutenberg-Richter Parameters

The Gutenberg-Richter equation describes the frequency-magnitude distribution of earthquakes as $\log_{10}(n) = a_0 - b \times M$, where $b$ is the Richter b-value, $M$ is magnitude, and $n$ is the number of earthquakes. A lower b-value means that the ratio of large to small earthquakes is higher, increasing the probability of larger magnitude events [@EpistemicCompile][@Meletlidis2022].

For the Reitfontein Fault, three different b-values are employed in the current probabilistic seismic hazard assessment: 1.35 with weight 0.30, 1.10 with weight 0.60, and 1.99 with weight 0.10 [@EpistemicCompile]. The dominant weight of 0.60 on the intermediate b-value of 1.10 suggests this is the most representative value for the Reitfontein Fault [@EpistemicCompile]. The lower b-value of 1.35 increases the relative probability of larger magnitude events, while the high b-value of 1.99 represents a scenario where earthquake activity is dominated by smaller events [@EpistemicCompile].

The EZ-FRISK zones have b-values of 1.04 for Drakensberg and 1.06 for Kaapvaal, which are consistent with the global average for tectonic earthquakes [@EpistemicCompile]. The Reitfontein Fault's central b-value of 1.10 is slightly higher than these regional values, and the weighted b-value of 1.35 is substantially higher [@EpistemicCompile].

Global and regional surveys show empirically determined b-values are remarkably stable, generally limited to values of $1 \pm 0.2$ (0.8 to 1.2) [@EpistemicCompile]. The Reitfontein values of 1.35 and 1.10 fall within or near this typical range, while the b-value of 1.99 is unusually high and represents a conservative scenario where small earthquakes dominate, making approach to $M_{\text{max}}$ highly improbable [@EpistemicCompile].

The probabilistic seismic hazard assessment study excludes events suspected of being mining-related with magnitudes less than M4.0 to minimize the influence of induced seismicity [@EpistemicCompile]. Mining-induced seismicity falls into two main categories: collapsing of highly stressed rock masses and shear along geological planes of weakness, with the mechanism involving stress redistribution due to excavation resulting in fracture initiation and movement along pre-existing planes [@EpistemicCompile].

The current b-value logic tree appropriately captures epistemic uncertainty through three branches spanning the range from slightly below the global average (1.10) to substantially above it (1.35, 1.99), with the highest weight on the intermediate value consistent with regional b-values for the Kaapvaal and Drakensberg zones. Consideration could be given to including a branch at $b = 1.0$ or slightly below to reflect the possibility of a b-value closer to the global tectonic average [@EpistemicCompile][@Singh2009].
