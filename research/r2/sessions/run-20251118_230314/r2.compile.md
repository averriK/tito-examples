# Reitfontein Fault Epistemic Uncertainty Analysis

## Fault Classification and Activity

The Reitfontein Fault is classified as a paleoseismic structure rather than a neotectonic fault based on comprehensive geological, seismological, and geophysical evidence [@EpistemicCompile2024]. A neotectonic fault is formally defined as one that has hosted displacement under conditions imposed by the current crustal stress regime, established in South Africa sometime in the last 40 to 11 million years, with active faults conventionally defined as structures known to have produced historical earthquakes or shown evidence of movement in the last 35,000 years [@EpistemicCompile2024][@Singh2009][@USGS2020].

The Reitfontein Fault, at least 2.0 Ga old and having accommodated both normal and oblique reverse movement in the geological past within the Kaapvaal Craton (an Archean cratonic structure formed between 2.7 and 3.7 Ga), lacks the characteristic indicators of recent activity observed on documented neotectonic faults in South Africa such as thermal springs, fault scarps displacing young sediments, or geodetic strain accumulation [@EpistemicCompile2024]. Singh et al. (2009) specifically identified the Reitfontein Fault as one of several faults requiring reassessment to determine if still active, indicating that active classification was uncertain and did not constitute evidence of neotectonic classification [@EpistemicCompile2024][@Singh2009].

The fault has only been associated with minor present-day seismic activity. Other neotectonic faults in the Kaapvaal Craton such as the Zebediela, Thabazimbi, and Moshaweng faults exhibit observable geomorphic or structural evidence of recent activity such as thermal springs or repeated extensional reactivations that are notably absent for the Reitfontein Fault [@EpistemicCompile2024]. The characterization as a reportedly active fault with an assigned slip rate of 1 m/Myr represents a conservative engineering assumption rather than empirical evidence, and the fault retains some capacity for minor seismic reactivation under the current stress regime but lacks definitive evidence of sustained neotectonic activity [@EpistemicCompile2024].

## Evidence for Recent Activity

Based on comprehensive analysis of knowledge base sources, there is no geological or geomorphological evidence to suggest neotectonic activity on the Reitfontein Fault within the last 35,000 years, and no evidence has been documented that would permit affirmation of fault activity within this timeframe [@EpistemicCompile2024]. The fault lacks documented surface ruptures, displaced young sediments, geomorphic expression of recent faulting, or other indicators that would satisfy the conventional definition of an active fault [@EpistemicCompile2024].

A field investigation would be required to improve understanding and reduce uncertainties associated with activity rates, with paleoseismic investigations potentially including trenching, dating of displaced units, or analysis of geomorphological features. The absence of such investigations represents a critical data gap that prevents definitive assessment of Holocene or Late Pleistocene activity [@EpistemicCompile2024][@Singh2009].

For comparative context, the Kango Fault in the southern Cape Fold Belt provides the most robust paleoseismic evidence for large prehistoric earthquakes in South Africa, with paleoseismic trench investigation finding a $2.0 \pm 0.06$ m free-standing fault scarp with moment magnitude estimated between $M_w$ $6.97 \pm 0.01$ and $7.18 \pm 0.01$, and this fault has measured slip rates on the order of 200 m/Myr, which is 200 times higher than Reitfontein's assigned rate [@EpistemicCompile2024][@Roblin2016]. In stable continental regions, faults may exhibit episodic behavior with recurrence intervals of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years between ground-rupturing events, and paleoseismic studies emphasize the danger of over-reliance on instrumental catalogs in regions with recurrence intervals of 10,000-100,000+ years [@EpistemicCompile2024][@ClarkMcCue2015].

Research indicates that fault slip rates in the order of 5-10 m/Myr in stable continental regions would be beneath the detection limit of cosmogenic radionuclide methods, suggesting that 1 m/Myr represents an exceptionally slow slip rate at or below detection limits for many paleoseismic methods in stable continental region settings [@EpistemicCompile2024][@ClarkMcCue2015]. The absence of evidence for recent activity does not definitively exclude the possibility of rare, episodic large earthquakes characteristic of stable continental region settings, but neither does it provide positive evidence for such activity, and the very low assigned slip rate (1 m/Myr) combined with lack of observable neotectonic features suggests that if the fault has been active in the last 35,000 years, the activity rate would be at or below detection limits of standard paleoseismic methods [@EpistemicCompile2024].

## Maximum Magnitude Assessment

The $M_{\text{max}}$ of 7.2 for the Reitfontein Fault has been determined using the Wells and Coppersmith (1994) relationship for a 64 km fault length, which showed log-linear regressions between earthquake magnitude and surface rupture length with strong correlations and standard deviations of 0.25 to 0.35 magnitude units, implying that for a 64 km fault, magnitudes could reasonably range from approximately 6.85 to 7.55 based solely on scaling relationship uncertainty [@EpistemicCompile2024][@WellsCoppersmith1994].

Critical caveats apply because not all mapped fault length necessarily represents seismogenic length capable of rupturing in a single earthquake, stable continental region earthquakes may exhibit different scaling relationships than active tectonic region earthquakes for which the Wells-Coppersmith database is dominated, and the 64 km rupture length assumption is justified as a conservative estimate based on mapped extent, though actual seismogenic length may be considerably shorter [@EpistemicCompile2024][@LeonardClark2021][@Leonard2021].

The $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$ represents an unusually high value for the South African stable continental region, where current probabilistic seismic hazard assessment models assign $M_{\text{max}}$ values ranging from 5.3 to 6.3 for most regional zones, though the EZ-FRISK Africa model assigns $M_{\text{max}}$ values of 7.23 to the Drakensberg zone (820,725 square kilometers) and 7.0 to the Kaapvaal zone (281,858 square kilometers) [@EpistemicCompile2024].

Research on cratonic lithosphere indicates that for cratonic interiors with seismically determined thick lithosphere, the maximum moment magnitude found in the earthquake catalog is $M_{c\text{max}} = 6.0$, and no earthquakes with $M_w > 6$ have occurred above mantle lithosphere with $\delta V_S > 3.5$ percent, a characteristic of cold cratonic regions [@EpistemicCompile2024]. The largest recorded earthquake in South Africa was the Ceres event of September 29, 1969, with magnitude $M_w$ 6.2, representing a 1.0 magnitude unit difference (or 32 times difference in seismic moment release) from the assigned $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$ [@EpistemicCompile2024][@Malagnini2014].

Paleoseismic evidence from stable continental regions globally indicates that prehistoric earthquakes may have greatly exceeded maximum observed instrumental magnitudes, with Australian stable continental region faults yielding $M_{\text{max}}$ estimates of $7.0-7.5 \pm 0.2$ based on multiple documented paleoearthquakes (representing arguably the richest Late Neogene to Quaternary faulting record in stable continental region crust anywhere in the world), and the Kango Fault paleoseismic evidence in South Africa demonstrates that $M_w$ 6.97 to 7.18 events are physically possible in the South African tectonic setting [@EpistemicCompile2024][@Roblin2016].

Logic tree weights for $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$ should reflect substantial epistemic uncertainty given the absence of neotectonic evidence, the cratonic constraints suggesting $M_{c\text{max}} = 6.0$, the 200-fold difference in slip rates compared to the Kango Fault which produced similar magnitude events, and the fact that length-based $M_{\text{max}}$ estimation provides an upper bound on potential earthquake size but does not address the probability that such earthquakes can actually occur within relevant timeframes [@EpistemicCompile2024].

## Slip Rate Constraints

No slip rate has been published for the Reitfontein Fault, and the assigned 1 m/Myr value is a conservative engineering assumption with no empirical slip-rate evidence, representing a low uplift rate assigned for bedrock faults that do not show evidence of movement in the last 10 million years but are included due to favorable orientation [@EpistemicCompile2024]. When slip rates are not quantified, they are estimated based on all other available data, and for bedrock faults that do not show evidence of movement in the last 10 million years but are included due to favorable orientation, a low uplift rate of 1 m/Myr is assigned [@EpistemicCompile2024].

Some of the more active faults in South Africa have slip rates on the order of 200 m/Myr such as the Kango Fault, which is 200 times higher than Reitfontein's assigned rate yet produces similar maximum magnitudes [@EpistemicCompile2024][@Roblin2016]. The Pretorius Fault is also assigned a slip rate of 1 m/Myr in the absence of published estimates, placing both faults at the lower end of the slip-rate spectrum for active structures in South Africa [@EpistemicCompile2024].

The absence of quantified slip-rate data reflects the general paucity of paleoseismic studies on South African faults [@EpistemicCompile2024]. Within intraplate environments, deformation is transient, occurring in discrete episodes separated by long hiatuses, with faults in stable continental regions exhibiting episodic behavior with recurrence intervals of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years between ground-rupturing events [@EpistemicCompile2024]. Cratonic faults in stable continental regions typically have long-term behavior characterized by episodes of activity separated by quiescent intervals of at least 10,000 and commonly 100,000 years or more, and the long-term slip rate on cratonic stable continental region faults is extremely low, making the geomorphic expression subtle and scarps difficult to detect because they are poorly preserved [@ClarkMcCue2015].

Logic tree development for slip rate should incorporate a range reflecting this epistemic uncertainty, with lower branches weighted more heavily given the absence of observable neotectonic features that would be expected from sustained slip at rates of 1 m/Myr or higher over Holocene timescales, the very slow deformation rates characteristic of cratonic environments that make identifying paleoseismic evidence particularly challenging, and the fact that if the fault is active, the slip rate is likely below 1 m/Myr based on the complete absence of geomorphic evidence [@EpistemicCompile2024][@Singh2009]. A recommended approach would incorporate slip rate branches spanning 0.1 m/Myr to 10 m/Myr with highest weight on the 0.1-1 m/Myr range, acknowledging that field investigations would be required to improve understanding and reduce uncertainties associated with activity rates, and that paleoseismic investigation of Reitfontein would face substantial methodological challenges given slip rates of 5-10 m/Myr would be beneath detection limits [@EpistemicCompile2024].

## Return Period and Recurrence Analysis

The assessment of whether the slip rate range permits seismic movements in return periods less than 1/10,000 years (annual probability greater than $10^{-4}$) requires consideration of the relationship between slip rate, earthquake magnitude, and recurrence interval through the characteristic earthquake model and Gutenberg-Richter recurrence relationship [@EpistemicCompile2024]. The $M_{\text{max}}$ value primarily influences long-return-period hazard estimates of 10,000 years and beyond and deterministic scenario analyses, while disaggregation of the hazard shows that the majority of hazard comes from lower magnitudes for moderate return periods, and $M_{\text{max}}$ does not critically affect ground motion recurrence estimates for return periods up to hundreds of years, especially when the b-value is high [@EpistemicCompile2024].

For the Reitfontein Fault with $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$, the minimum magnitude $M_{\text{min}} = 5.7$, and for $M_{\text{max}}$ between 6.5 and 7.4, $M_{\text{min}} = M_{\text{max}} - 1.5$, yielding a range of 5.0 to 5.9 [@EpistemicCompile2024]. Three different b-values are employed: 1.35 with weight 0.30, 1.10 with weight 0.60, and 1.99 with weight 0.10, where a lower b-value means that the ratio of large to small earthquakes is higher, increasing the probability of larger magnitude events [@EpistemicCompile2024].

Critical caveats fundamentally constrain the probability of $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$ events in short return periods, including the complete lack of geological or geomorphological evidence for recent activity that contradicts the slip rates of 1 m/Myr or greater that would produce observable surface deformation over Holocene timescales, the cratonic constraint of $M_{c\text{max}} = 6.0$ for cratonic interiors suggesting that $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$ events may not be physically realizable regardless of return period, and the episodic behavior of stable continental region faults with recurrence intervals potentially exceeding 100,000 years making deterministic recurrence calculations highly uncertain [@EpistemicCompile2024].

In stable continental regions, faults may exhibit episodic behavior with recurrence intervals of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years between ground-rupturing events, and the Kango Fault paleoseismic evidence shows an early Holocene earthquake approximately 10,000 to 12,000 years ago despite having slip rates 200 times higher than Reitfontein [@EpistemicCompile2024].

The largest mining-related seismic event ever to occur in South Africa registered magnitude 5.3 on March 9, 2005, and mining-induced seismicity is highly unlikely to trigger rupture of the entire 64 km Reitfontein Fault, with most seismic events associated with mining localized to the mining area and adjacent structures [@EpistemicCompile2024]. While slip rates of 1-20 m/Myr mathematically permit return periods less than 10,000 years for events approaching $M_{\text{max}}$, multiple physical constraints suggest such events are highly improbable, and for return periods in the range of 475-2,475 years typical for building code applications, the hazard is almost certainly dominated by smaller magnitude events in the range of $M$ 5.5-6.5 rather than approach to $M_{\text{max}}$, particularly for the higher b-value branches [@EpistemicCompile2024].

## Gutenberg-Richter Parameters

The Gutenberg-Richter equation describes the frequency-magnitude distribution of earthquakes as $\log_{10}(n) = a_0 - b \times M$, where $b$ is the Richter b-value, $M$ is magnitude, and $n$ is the number of earthquakes, with a lower b-value meaning that the ratio of large to small earthquakes is higher, increasing the probability of larger magnitude events [@EpistemicCompile2024][@Meletlidis2022]. For the Reitfontein Fault, three different b-values are employed: 1.35 with weight 0.30, 1.10 with weight 0.60, and 1.99 with weight 0.10, where the dominant weight of 0.60 on the intermediate b-value of 1.10 suggests this is the most representative value for the Reitfontein Fault [@EpistemicCompile2024].

The lower b-value of 1.35 with weight 0.30 increases the relative probability of larger magnitude events, while the high b-value of 1.99 with low weight of 0.10 represents a scenario where earthquake activity is dominated by smaller events [@EpistemicCompile2024]. The EZ-FRISK zones have b-values of 1.04 for Drakensberg and 1.06 for Kaapvaal, which are regional b-values consistent with the global average for tectonic earthquakes, while the Reitfontein Fault's central b-value of 1.10 is slightly higher than these regional values, and the weighted b-value of 1.35 is substantially higher [@EpistemicCompile2024].

Global and regional surveys show empirically determined b-values are remarkably stable, generally limited to values of $1 \pm 0.2$ (0.8 to 1.2), and the Reitfontein values of 1.35 and 1.10 fall within or near this typical range, while the b-value of 1.99 with weight 0.10 is unusually high and represents a conservative scenario where small earthquakes dominate, making approach to $M_{\text{max}}$ highly improbable [@EpistemicCompile2024].

The probabilistic seismic hazard assessment study excludes events suspected of being mining-related with magnitudes less than M4.0 to minimize the influence of induced seismicity, and mining-induced seismicity falls into two main categories: collapsing of highly stressed rock masses and shear along geological planes of weakness, with the mechanism involving stress redistribution due to excavation resulting in fracture initiation and movement along pre-existing planes [@EpistemicCompile2024]. Mining in the Witwatersrand Basin currently approaches depths of 4,000 meters, while in stable continental regions with thick lithosphere, seismogenic depths typically extend to 15-25 km, and the Reitfontein Fault is located 43 km from the South Deep Mine site [@EpistemicCompile2024]. In stable continental regions with thick lithosphere, seismogenic depths typically extend to 15 to 25 km, and the Kaapvaal Craton seismogenic structure has documented activity at 5 to 16 km depth [@EpistemicCompile2024].

The current b-value logic tree appropriately captures epistemic uncertainty through three branches spanning the range from slightly below the global average (1.10) to substantially above it (1.35, 1.99), with the highest weight on the intermediate value consistent with regional b-values for the Kaapvaal and Drakensberg zones, though consideration could be given to including a branch at b equals 1.0 or slightly below to reflect the possibility of a b-value closer to the global tectonic average [@EpistemicCompile2024][@Singh2009].
