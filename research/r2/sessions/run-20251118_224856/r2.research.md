# Executive Summary and Recommendations: Reitfontein Fault Epistemic Uncertainty Analysis

## SLOT 1: Executive Summary of Reitfontein Fault Analysis

The Reitfontein Fault is classified as a paleoseismic structure rather than a neotectonic fault based on the absence of geological or geomorphological evidence of movement in the last 35,000 years and only minor present-day seismic activity [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Neotectonic faults are formally defined as structures that have hosted displacement under conditions imposed by the current crustal stress regime, which was established in South Africa sometime in the last 40 to 11 million years [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Active faults are conventionally defined as structures known to have produced historical earthquakes or shown evidence of movement in the last 35,000 years [KB:epistemic.compile.md][WEB:https://www.usgs.gov/publications/neotectonic-and-paleoseismic-analysis-northwest-extent-holocene-surface-deformation]. Singh et al. (2009) specifically identified the Reitfontein Fault as requiring reassessment to determine if still active, indicating that active classification was uncertain rather than established [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Other neotectonic faults in the Kaapvaal Craton, including the Zebediela, Thabazimbi, and Moshaweng faults, exhibit observable geomorphic or structural evidence of recent activity such as thermal springs or repeated extensional reactivations, which are notably absent for the Reitfontein Fault [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The characterization as an active fault with assigned slip rate of 1 m/Myr represents a conservative engineering assumption rather than empirically demonstrated activity, and the fault is best classified as a paleoseismic structure that may retain some capacity for minor seismic reactivation under the current stress regime [KB:epistemic.compile.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph is fully supported by the KB document epistemic.compile.md, which provides comprehensive citations including Singh et al. (2009), Wells and Coppersmith (1994), and other authoritative sources. The distinction between paleoseismic and neotectonic faults is clearly defined with specific criteria (35,000 years for active faults, current stress regime for neotectonic faults). The comparison with other regional faults (Zebediela, Thabazimbi, Moshaweng) that exhibit observable neotectonic features is documented in the KB. The characterization of the 1 m/Myr slip rate as a conservative engineering assumption is explicitly stated in the KB document. External validation from USGS paleoseismic fault classification standards [WEB:https://www.usgs.gov/publications/neotectonic-and-paleoseismic-analysis-northwest-extent-holocene-surface-deformation] confirms the 35,000-year criterion for active fault classification in stable continental regions.]

Based on comprehensive analysis, there is no evidence in the analyzed sources that permits affirmation of Reitfontein Fault activity in the last 35,000 years [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The fault lacks documented surface ruptures, displaced young sediments, geomorphic expression of recent faulting, or other indicators that would satisfy the conventional definition of an active fault [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The Kango Fault in the southern Cape Fold Belt provides comparative context, with paleoseismic trench investigation finding a $2.0 \pm 0.06$ m free-standing fault scarp with moment magnitude estimated between $M_w$ $6.97 \pm 0.01$ and $7.18 \pm 0.01$, demonstrating that faults with demonstrable recent activity in South Africa exhibit substantially higher slip rates (200 m/Myr compared to Reitfontein's 1 m/Myr) and observable surface expression [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The absence of paleoseismic investigations for the Reitfontein Fault represents a significant data gap that prevents definitive assessment of Holocene or Late Pleistocene activity [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Research indicates that fault slip rates in the order of 5-10 m/Myr in stable continental regions would be beneath the detection limit of cosmogenic radionuclide methods, suggesting that the very low assigned slip rate of 1 m/Myr represents an exceptionally slow rate at or below detection limits for many paleoseismic methods in stable continental region settings [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. In stable continental regions, faults may exhibit episodic behavior with recurrence intervals of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years between ground-rupturing events, and paleoseismic studies emphasize the danger of over-reliance on instrumental catalogs in regions with recurrence intervals of 10,000 to 100,000 years or longer [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The absence of evidence for recent activity does not definitively exclude the possibility of rare, episodic large earthquakes characteristic of stable continental region settings, but neither does it provide positive evidence for such activity [KB:epistemic.compile.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph is thoroughly supported by multiple specific facts from the KB document epistemic.compile.md. The absence of evidence for activity in the last 35,000 years is explicitly stated. The comparison with the Kango Fault is quantitatively precise, citing specific slip rates (200 m/Myr vs. 1 m/Myr), magnitude estimates ($M_w$ 6.97-7.18 with uncertainties), and scarp measurements (2.0 ± 0.06 m), all drawn directly from the KB. The paleoseismic data gap is acknowledged in the KB. The detection limit statement (5-10 m/Myr for cosmogenic radionuclide methods) is cited from ResearchGate sources referenced in the KB. The episodic behavior characteristics of SCR faults with recurrence intervals of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years are documented in the KB with citations to ScienceDirect sources. The nuanced conclusion acknowledging both the absence of positive evidence and the inherent limitations of instrumental catalogs in SCR settings reflects the balanced assessment provided in the KB.]

The maximum magnitude $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$ for the Reitfontein Fault has been determined using the Wells and Coppersmith (1994) relationship applied to the fault's 64 km mapped length, with log-linear regressions showing standard deviations of 0.25 to 0.35 magnitude units, implying that magnitudes could reasonably range from approximately 6.85 to 7.55 based solely on scaling relationship uncertainty [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Critical caveats apply because not all mapped fault length necessarily represents seismogenic length capable of rupturing in a single earthquake, and stable continental region earthquakes may exhibit different scaling relationships than active tectonic region earthquakes [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$ represents an unusually high value for the South African stable continental region, where current probabilistic seismic hazard assessment models assign $M_{\text{max}}$ values ranging from 5.3 to 6.3 for most regional zones [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Research on cratonic lithosphere indicates that for cratonic interiors with seismically determined thick lithosphere, the catalog maximum moment magnitude is $M_{c\text{max}} = 6.0$, and no earthquakes with $M_w > 6$ have occurred above mantle lithosphere with $\delta V_S > 3.5\%$, a characteristic of cold cratonic regions [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The largest recorded earthquake in South Africa was the Ceres event of September 29, 1969, with magnitude $M_w$ 6.2, representing a 1.0 magnitude unit difference, equivalent to 32 times the seismic moment release, from the assigned $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$ [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Paleoseismic evidence from stable continental regions globally indicates that prehistoric earthquakes may have greatly exceeded maximum observed instrumental magnitudes, with Australian stable continental region faults yielding $M_{\text{max}}$ estimates of $7.0-7.5 \pm 0.2$ based on multiple documented paleoearthquakes, representing arguably the richest Late Neogene to Quaternary faulting record in stable continental region crust anywhere in the world [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The Kango Fault paleoseismic evidence in South Africa demonstrates that $M_w$ 6.97 to 7.18 events are physically possible in the South African tectonic setting [KB:epistemic.compile.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph presents quantitative data and analysis that is comprehensively documented in the KB document epistemic.compile.md. The Wells and Coppersmith (1994) magnitude-length scaling relationship, including specific standard deviation values (0.25-0.35 magnitude units) and the resulting magnitude range (6.85-7.55), is cited from the KB. The caveats regarding seismogenic length and SCR vs. active tectonic region scaling differences are explicitly discussed in the KB. The regional context is quantified with specific $M_{\text{max}}$ values (5.3-6.3 for most zones) from current PSHA models cited in the KB. The Mooney et al. (2012) cratonic constraints ($M_{c\text{max}} = 6.0$, no $M_w > 6$ above mantle lithosphere with $\delta V_S > 3.5\%$) are directly cited from the KB with proper attribution. The Ceres earthquake magnitude (6.2, September 29, 1969) and the seismic moment calculation (32 times difference) are documented in the KB with citation to Malagnini (2014). The Australian SCR paleoseismic evidence (7.0-7.5 ± 0.2) and characterization as the richest Late Neogene to Quaternary faulting record are cited from the KB. The Kango Fault magnitude range (6.97-7.18) is consistent with earlier statements in this document and the KB.]

No slip rate has been published for the Reitfontein Fault, and the assigned value of 1 m/Myr represents a conservative engineering assumption rather than empirical measurement [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. When slip rates are not quantified, they are estimated based on all other available data, and for bedrock faults that do not show evidence of movement in the last 10 million years but are included due to favorable orientation, a low uplift rate of 1 m/Myr is assigned [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Some of the more active faults in South Africa have slip rates on the order of 200 m/Myr, such as the Kango Fault, which is 200 times higher than Reitfontein's assigned rate yet produces similar maximum magnitudes [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The Pretorius Fault is also assigned a slip rate of 1 m/Myr in the absence of published estimates, placing both faults at the lower end of the slip-rate spectrum for active structures in South Africa [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The absence of quantified slip-rate data reflects the general paucity of paleoseismic studies on South African faults [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Within intraplate environments, deformation is transient, occurring in discrete episodes separated by long hiatuses, and in stable continental regions, faults may exhibit episodic behavior with recurrence intervals of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years between ground-rupturing events [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. In stable continental regions with thick lithosphere, seismogenic depths typically extend to 15 to 25 km, and the Kaapvaal Craton seismogenic structure has documented activity at 5 to 16 km depth [KB:epistemic.compile.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately summarizes slip rate data and context from the KB document epistemic.compile.md. The absence of published slip rates and the characterization of 1 m/Myr as a conservative assumption is explicitly stated in the KB. The methodology for assigning slip rates to bedrock faults without evidence of movement in the last 10 million years is documented in the KB. The comparison with the Kango Fault (200 m/Myr, 200 times higher than Reitfontein) and the similar maximum magnitudes despite vastly different slip rates are quantitatively cited from the KB. The reference to the Pretorius Fault having the same assigned slip rate (1 m/Myr) is documented in the KB. The characterization of transient, episodic deformation in intraplate environments with long hiatuses and recurrence intervals of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years is cited from ScienceDirect sources referenced in the KB. The seismogenic depth ranges (15-25 km for SCR generally, 5-16 km for Kaapvaal Craton specifically) are documented in the KB with appropriate citations.]

To assess whether seismic movements could occur in return periods less than 1/10,000 years (annual probability $> 10^{-4}$), the relationship between slip rate, earthquake magnitude, and recurrence interval must be considered within the characteristic earthquake model and Gutenberg-Richter recurrence framework [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The $M_{\text{max}}$ value primarily influences long-return-period hazard estimates of 10,000 years and beyond and deterministic scenario analyses, while disaggregation of the hazard shows that the majority of hazard comes from lower magnitudes for moderate return periods [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. For the Reitfontein Fault with $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$, the minimum magnitude is $M_{\text{min}} = 5.7$, and for $M_{\text{max}}$ between 6.5 and 7.4, $M_{\text{min}} = M_{\text{max}} - 1.5$, yielding a range of 5.0 to 5.9 [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. In stable continental regions, faults may exhibit episodic behavior with recurrence intervals of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years between ground-rupturing events, and the Kango Fault paleoseismic evidence shows an early Holocene earthquake approximately 10,000 to 12,000 years ago despite having slip rates 200 times higher than Reitfontein [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The complete lack of geological or geomorphological evidence for recent activity contradicts the slip rates greater than or equal to 1 m/Myr that would produce observable surface deformation over Holocene timescales [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The $M_{c\text{max}} = 6.0$ constraint for cratonic interiors suggests that $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$ events may not be physically realizable regardless of return period [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Mining-induced seismicity is highly unlikely to trigger rupture of the entire 64 km Reitfontein Fault, as the largest mining-related seismic event ever to occur in South Africa registered magnitude 5.3 on March 9, 2005, and most seismic events associated with mining are localized to the mining area and adjacent structures [KB:epistemic.compile.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately presents the recurrence analysis framework and critical constraints from the KB document epistemic.compile.md. The relationship between $M_{\text{max}}$ and return periods (primarily influencing 10,000+ year estimates) and the role of lower magnitudes in moderate return period hazard are documented in the KB. The specific values for minimum magnitude ($M_{\text{min}} = 5.7$ for $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$, and the general formula $M_{\text{min}} = M_{\text{max}} - 1.5$ for $M_{\text{max}}$ between 6.5 and 7.4) are cited from the KB. The episodic behavior characteristics and the Kango Fault Holocene earthquake timing (10,000-12,000 years ago) with 200 times higher slip rates are documented in the KB. The logical contradiction between the absence of neotectonic evidence and slip rates ≥1 m/Myr that should produce observable Holocene deformation is explicitly discussed in the KB. The cratonic $M_{c\text{max}} = 6.0$ constraint from Mooney et al. (2012) and its implications for the realizability of $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$ events are cited from the KB. The mining-induced seismicity data (largest event M 5.3 on March 9, 2005) and the localized nature of mining-related seismicity are documented in the KB with specific dates and magnitudes.]

The Gutenberg-Richter equation describes the frequency-magnitude distribution of earthquakes as $\log_{10}(n) = a_0 - b \times M$, where $b$ is the Richter b-value, $M$ is magnitude, and $n$ is the number of earthquakes, with a lower b-value meaning that the ratio of large to small earthquakes is higher, increasing the probability of larger magnitude events [KB:epistemic.compile.md][WEB:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00024-022-03143-4]. For the Reitfontein Fault, three different b-values are employed in the current probabilistic seismic hazard assessment: 1.35 with weight 0.30, 1.10 with weight 0.60, and 1.99 with weight 0.10 [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The dominant weight of 0.60 on the intermediate b-value of 1.10 suggests this is the most representative value for the Reitfontein Fault [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The EZ-FRISK zones have b-values of 1.04 for Drakensberg and 1.06 for Kaapvaal, which are regional b-values consistent with the global average for tectonic earthquakes [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Global and regional surveys show empirically determined b-values are remarkably stable, generally limited to values of $1 \pm 0.2$, that is, 0.8 to 1.2 [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The Reitfontein values of 1.35 and 1.10 fall within or near this typical range, while the b-value of 1.99 with weight 0.10 is unusually high and represents a conservative scenario where small earthquakes dominate, making approach to $M_{\text{max}}$ highly improbable [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The probabilistic seismic hazard assessment study excludes events suspected of being mining-related with magnitudes less than M4.0 to minimize the influence of induced seismicity [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Mining in the Witwatersrand Basin currently approaches depths of 4,000 meters, while in stable continental regions with thick lithosphere, seismogenic depths typically extend to 15 to 25 km, and the Reitfontein Fault is located 43 km from the South Deep Mine site [KB:epistemic.compile.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately presents the Gutenberg-Richter framework and b-value data from the KB document epistemic.compile.md, supplemented with external validation on epistemic uncertainty treatment from Springer journal sources [WEB:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00024-022-03143-4]. The Gutenberg-Richter equation and the interpretation of b-value effects on magnitude distribution are correctly stated and documented in the KB. The three specific b-values for Reitfontein (1.35 at weight 0.30, 1.10 at weight 0.60, 1.99 at weight 0.10) are cited from Meletlidis et al. (2014) as referenced in the KB. The interpretation of the 0.60 weight on b=1.10 as the most representative value is stated in the KB. The EZ-FRISK regional b-values (1.04 Drakensberg, 1.06 Kaapvaal) are cited from the KB. The empirical constraint of $1 \pm 0.2$ (0.8-1.2) for stable b-values is explicitly cited from Meletlidis et al. (2014) in the KB. The characterization of b=1.99 as unusually high and making approach to $M_{\text{max}}$ highly improbable is stated in the KB with citation to Meletlidis et al. (2014). The mining exclusion criterion (M<4.0 suspected mining events) is documented in the KB. The mining depth (4,000 m), seismogenic depth range (15-25 km for SCR), and fault distance (43 km from South Deep Mine) are all quantitatively documented in the KB.]

## SLOT 2: Recommendations for Epistemic Uncertainty Treatment

Logic tree weights for maximum magnitude should reflect the fundamental tension between empirical scaling relationships and cratonic physical constraints. A three-branch logic tree structure is recommended: a low branch with $M_{\text{max}} = 6.5$ assigned weight 0.40 reflecting the cratonic $M_{c\text{max}} = 6.0$ constraint from Mooney et al. (2012) with allowance for paleoseismic exceedance, a central branch with $M_{\text{max}} = 7.0$ assigned weight 0.45 reflecting the EZ-FRISK Kaapvaal zone value and regional consensus, and a high branch with $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$ assigned weight 0.15 reflecting the Wells and Coppersmith (1994) full-length rupture scenario as an upper bound [KB:epistemic.compile.md][WEB:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00024-022-03143-4]. The rationale for emphasizing the lower branches is that the absence of neotectonic evidence, the exceptionally low slip rate of 1 m/Myr that is at or below paleoseismic detection limits, the absence of events exceeding $M_w$ 6.2 in the South African instrumental record spanning over a century, and the cratonic lithosphere constraints collectively suggest that events approaching $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$ are highly improbable within relevant engineering return periods [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The Australian stable continental region analogs that demonstrate $M_{\text{max}}$ 7.0 to 7.5 events exhibit substantially higher slip rates and observable paleoseismic evidence, characteristics absent for Reitfontein [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. This weight distribution maintains conservatism by retaining the possibility of large magnitude events while appropriately reflecting the preponderance of evidence suggesting lower maximum magnitudes are more credible for the Reitfontein Fault in its cratonic stable continental region setting [KB:epistemic.compile.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: This paragraph presents specific recommendations that synthesize evidence from the KB document epistemic.compile.md and epistemic uncertainty frameworks from external PSHA literature [WEB:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00024-022-03143-4]. The three-branch structure (6.5 at 0.40, 7.0 at 0.45, 7.2 at 0.15) is a new recommendation not directly stated in the KB but is based on: (1) the cratonic $M_{c\text{max}} = 6.0$ constraint from Mooney et al. (2012) cited in the KB, (2) the EZ-FRISK Kaapvaal zone $M_{\text{max}} = 7.0$ cited in the KB, and (3) the Wells and Coppersmith (1994) derived value of 7.2 cited in the KB. The weight distribution emphasizing lower branches is justified by multiple lines of evidence documented in the KB: absence of neotectonic evidence, 1 m/Myr slip rate at detection limits, historical record maximum of $M_w$ 6.2, and cratonic constraints. The comparison with Australian SCR analogs having higher slip rates and observable paleoseismic evidence is documented in the KB. The recommendation appropriately synthesizes the documented evidence but introduces a specific weight distribution that is the author's interpretation rather than directly cited values. Confidence is MEDIUM because while the underlying evidence is well-documented in the KB, the specific weight values represent an interpretive synthesis rather than empirically established values.]

Gutenberg-Richter parameter logic tree weights should be adjusted to reflect the dual considerations of cratonic stable continental region tectonic characteristics and the potential influence of mining-induced seismicity. The current implementation employs three b-values: 1.35 with weight 0.30, 1.10 with weight 0.60, and 1.99 with weight 0.10 [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. A recommended adjustment would shift emphasis toward the lower b-value branch by revising weights to 1.35 at weight 0.45, 1.10 at weight 0.45, and 1.99 at weight 0.10, thereby balancing the central and low branches more equally [KB:epistemic.compile.md][WEB:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00024-022-03143-4]. The rationale for increasing the weight on the lower b-value of 1.35 is that stable continental region seismicity in cratonic settings may exhibit relatively higher rates of larger magnitude events compared to smaller events, particularly when compared to active tectonic regions, and the episodic nature of stable continental region faulting with long recurrence intervals and discrete rupture episodes favors a lower b-value representation [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The regional EZ-FRISK b-values of 1.04 for Drakensberg and 1.06 for Kaapvaal fall below the central Reitfontein value of 1.10, supporting greater emphasis on the lower b-value branch [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The b-value of 1.99 should retain its low weight of 0.10 because global and regional surveys show empirically determined b-values are remarkably stable at $1 \pm 0.2$, and the value of 1.99 is unusually high and represents an extreme conservative scenario where small earthquakes dominate and approach to $M_{\text{max}}$ is highly improbable [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Mining-induced seismicity considerations support retaining the exclusion of events suspected of being mining-related with magnitudes less than M4.0, as mining-related events are typically localized and the largest mining-related seismic event in South Africa was magnitude 5.3, well below the fault's $M_{\text{max}}$ range [KB:epistemic.compile.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: This paragraph presents specific recommendations for Gutenberg-Richter parameter weights based on evidence from the KB document epistemic.compile.md and PSHA epistemic uncertainty literature [WEB:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00024-022-03143-4]. The current b-value implementation (1.35 at 0.30, 1.10 at 0.60, 1.99 at 0.10) is documented in the KB citing Meletlidis et al. (2014). The recommended revision (1.35 at 0.45, 1.10 at 0.45, 1.99 at 0.10) is a new recommendation representing a 0.15 weight shift from the central to the low branch. The rationale for emphasizing lower b-values in SCR cratonic settings is based on documented episodic faulting characteristics and long recurrence intervals in the KB. The regional EZ-FRISK b-values (1.04 Drakensberg, 1.06 Kaapvaal) are documented in the KB and correctly noted to fall below the Reitfontein central value of 1.10, supporting the lower b-value emphasis. The retention of 0.10 weight for b=1.99 is justified by the empirical constraint of $1 \pm 0.2$ for stable b-values cited from Meletlidis et al. (2014) in the KB. The mining-induced seismicity considerations (M4.0 exclusion criterion, largest mining event M 5.3) are documented in the KB. Confidence is MEDIUM because while the underlying evidence and current implementation are documented in the KB, the specific recommended weight adjustments represent an interpretive synthesis and engineering judgment rather than empirically established values.]

Consideration of a consistent slip rate across logic tree branches should account for the complete absence of published empirical measurements and the exceptionally low assigned value of 1 m/Myr, which is at or below detection limits for many paleoseismic methods in stable continental region settings [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Given that no slip rate has been published for the Reitfontein Fault and the 1 m/Myr value is acknowledged as a conservative engineering assumption rather than empirical evidence, a three-branch slip rate logic tree is recommended: a low branch with 0.5 m/Myr assigned weight 0.30 reflecting the possibility that activity rates are below current detection thresholds, a central branch with 1.0 m/Myr assigned weight 0.50 reflecting the current conservative baseline assumption, and a high branch with 2.0 m/Myr assigned weight 0.20 allowing for the possibility of episodic activity that might produce higher time-averaged slip rates over longer intervals [KB:epistemic.compile.md][WEB:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00024-022-03143-4]. The rationale for this distribution is that the absence of geological or geomorphological evidence for neotectonic activity suggests that if the fault is active, its slip rate is likely at the lower end of the range or below the assigned 1 m/Myr value [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Research indicates that fault slip rates in the order of 5 to 10 m/Myr in stable continental regions would be beneath the detection limit of cosmogenic radionuclide methods, and the Reitfontein assigned rate of 1 m/Myr is already at this threshold [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The stark contrast with documented active faults in South Africa, such as the Kango Fault with slip rates of 200 m/Myr and observable paleoseismic evidence, reinforces that Reitfontein represents a fundamentally different activity level [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The high branch of 2.0 m/Myr maintains conservatism while acknowledging that stable continental region faults may exhibit episodic behavior with discrete rupture episodes separated by long hiatuses, potentially producing time-averaged slip rates that differ from steady-state assumptions [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. This slip rate uncertainty should be incorporated consistently across all logic tree branches to properly propagate epistemic uncertainty through the probabilistic seismic hazard assessment calculation and avoid artificial precision based on an assumed deterministic slip rate value that lacks empirical foundation [KB:epistemic.compile.md][WEB:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00024-022-03143-4].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: This paragraph presents specific slip rate logic tree recommendations based on evidence from the KB document epistemic.compile.md and PSHA epistemic uncertainty frameworks [WEB:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00024-022-03143-4]. The absence of published slip rates, the characterization of 1 m/Myr as a conservative assumption rather than empirical measurement, and the statement that this rate is at or below detection limits are all documented in the KB. The recommended three-branch structure (0.5 m/Myr at 0.30, 1.0 m/Myr at 0.50, 2.0 m/Myr at 0.20) is a new recommendation not directly stated in the KB. The justification for the low branch (0.5 m/Myr) is based on documented absence of neotectonic evidence in the KB. The detection limit information (5-10 m/Myr beneath detection for cosmogenic methods) is cited from ResearchGate sources referenced in the KB. The comparison with the Kango Fault (200 m/Myr with observable paleoseismic evidence) is documented in the KB. The episodic behavior rationale for the high branch (2.0 m/Myr) is based on SCR fault characteristics documented in the KB, including discrete episodes separated by long hiatuses. The recommendation for consistent slip rate uncertainty propagation across logic tree branches is aligned with standard PSHA practice documented in the external Springer article on epistemic uncertainty. Confidence is MEDIUM because while the underlying evidence is well-documented in the KB, the specific slip rate values and weights represent an interpretive engineering recommendation rather than empirically established values.]
