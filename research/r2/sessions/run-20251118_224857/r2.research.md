# Executive Summary and Recommendations for Reitfontein Fault Epistemic Uncertainty Treatment

## SLOT 1: Executive Summary of Reitfontein Fault Analysis

### Paleoseismic or Neotectonic Classification

The Reitfontein Fault is best classified as a paleoseismic structure rather than a neotectonic fault based on multiple lines of evidence. The fault is at least 2.0 Ga old and has accommodated both normal and oblique reverse movement in the geological past within the Kaapvaal Craton, an Archean cratonic structure formed between 2.7 and 3.7 Ga [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. A neotectonic fault is formally defined as one that has hosted displacement under conditions imposed by the current crustal stress regime, established in South Africa sometime in the last 40 to 11 million years, while active faults are conventionally defined as structures known to have produced historical earthquakes or shown evidence of movement in the last 35,000 years [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. There is no known geological or geomorphological evidence to suggest neotectonic activity on the Reitfontein Fault, with the fault having only been associated with minor present-day seismic activity [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Singh et al. (2009) specifically identified the Reitfontein Fault as one of several faults requiring reassessment to determine if still active, indicating that active classification was uncertain even at the time of that synthesis [KB:epistemic.compile.md][WEB:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258773069_The_Seismotectonic_Model_of_Southern_Africa]. Other neotectonic faults in the Kaapvaal Craton, including the Zebediela, Thabazimbi, and Moshaweng faults, display observable geomorphic or structural evidence of recent activity such as thermal springs or repeated extensional reactivations that are notably absent for the Reitfontein Fault [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The characterization as a reportedly active fault with an assigned slip rate of 1 m/Myr represents a conservative engineering assumption rather than empirical evidence, and the fault is best understood as a paleoseismic structure that may retain some capacity for minor seismic reactivation under the current stress regime but lacks definitive evidence of sustained neotectonic activity [KB:epistemic.compile.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph's claims about the Reitfontein Fault classification are well-supported by the KB source epistemic.compile.md, which provides detailed information about fault age (2.0 Ga), absence of neotectonic evidence, and comparison with other faults. The paragraph correctly cites the formal definition of neotectonic and active faults, the timeframes (40-11 Ma for stress regime, 35,000 years for active classification), the identification by Singh et al. (2009) requiring reassessment, and the contrast with other regional faults showing thermal springs and reactivation evidence. The external web source from ResearchGate corroborates the need for reassessment of multiple faults including Reitfontein. The characterization as a conservative engineering assumption rather than empirical evidence is explicitly stated in the KB. All quantitative values, definitions, and comparative statements are directly traceable to the cited sources.]

### Evidence for Activity in the Last 35,000 Years

Based on comprehensive analysis of knowledge base sources, there is no geological or geomorphological evidence to suggest neotectonic activity on the Reitfontein Fault, and no evidence has been documented that would permit affirmation of fault activity within the last 35,000 years [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The fault lacks the characteristic indicators of recent activity observed on documented neotectonic faults in South Africa, such as thermal springs, fault scarps displacing young sediments, or geodetic strain accumulation [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. A field investigation would be required to improve understanding and reduce uncertainties associated with activity rates, with paleoseismic investigations potentially including trenching, dating of displaced units, or analysis of geomorphological features, though the absence of such investigations represents a critical data gap that prevents definitive assessment of Holocene or Late Pleistocene activity [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. For comparative context, the Kango Fault in the southern Cape Fold Belt provides the most robust paleoseismic evidence for large prehistoric earthquakes in South Africa, with paleoseismic trench investigation finding a $2.0 \pm 0.06$ m free-standing fault scarp with moment magnitude estimated between $M_w$ $6.97 \pm 0.01$ and $7.18 \pm 0.01$, and measured slip rates on the order of 200 m/Myr, which is 200 times higher than Reitfontein's assigned rate [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. In stable continental regions, faults may exhibit episodic behavior with recurrence intervals of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years between ground-rupturing events, and paleoseismic studies emphasize the danger of over-reliance on instrumental catalogs in regions with recurrence intervals of 10,000-100,000+ years [KB:epistemic.compile.md][WEB:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281460177_Paleoseismicity_of_Two_Historically_Quiescent_Faults_in_Australia_Implications_for_Fault_Behavior_in_Stable_Continental_Regions]. The absence of evidence for recent activity does not definitively exclude the possibility of rare, episodic large earthquakes characteristic of stable continental region settings, but neither does it provide positive evidence for such activity, and the very low assigned slip rate (1 m/Myr) combined with lack of observable neotectonic features suggests that if the fault has been active in the last 35,000 years, the activity rate would be at or below detection limits of standard paleoseismic methods [KB:epistemic.compile.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph presents claims about absence of evidence for Holocene activity, paleoseismic investigation gaps, and comparative data from the Kango Fault that are fully supported by KB:epistemic.compile.md. The specific quantitative values are accurately cited: Kango Fault scarp height ($2.0 \pm 0.06$ m), magnitude estimates ($M_w$ $6.97 \pm 0.01$ to $7.18 \pm 0.01$), and slip rate comparison (200 m/Myr vs 1 m/Myr). The external web source on Australian stable continental region paleoseismicity corroborates the episodic behavior and long recurrence intervals (10,000-100,000+ years) characteristic of SCR faults. The paragraph correctly notes the absence of thermal springs, fault scarps, and geodetic evidence as distinguishing features. The statement about detection limits is explicitly supported by the KB source. All claims about investigation needs, data gaps, and episodic behavior are directly traceable to cited sources with no unsupported inferences.]

### Logic Tree Weights for $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$

The $M_{\text{max}}$ of 7.2 has been determined using the Wells and Coppersmith (1994) relationship for a 64 km fault length, with log-linear regressions between earthquake magnitude and surface rupture length showing strong correlations with standard deviations of 0.25 to 0.35 magnitude units, implying that for a 64 km fault, magnitudes could reasonably range from approximately 6.85 to 7.55 based solely on scaling relationship uncertainty [KB:epistemic.compile.md][WEB:https://www.resolutionmineeis.us/sites/default/files/references/wells-coppersmith-1994.pdf]. Critical caveats apply to this calculation: not all mapped fault length necessarily represents seismogenic length capable of rupturing in a single earthquake, stable continental region earthquakes may exhibit different scaling relationships than active tectonic region earthquakes, and the 64 km rupture length assumption is justified as a conservative estimate based on mapped extent, though actual seismogenic length may be considerably shorter [KB:epistemic.compile.md][WEB:https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/8755293020988024]. The $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$ represents an unusually high value for the South African stable continental region, with current South African PSHA models assigning $M_{\text{max}}$ values ranging from 5.3-6.3 for most regional zones, while the EZ-FRISK Africa model assigns $M_{\text{max}}$ values of 7.23 to the Drakensberg zone and 7.0 to the Kaapvaal zone [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Research on cratonic lithosphere indicates that for cratonic interiors with seismically determined thick lithosphere, the maximum moment magnitude found in the earthquake catalog is $M_{c\text{max}} = 6.0$, and no earthquakes with $M_w > 6$ have occurred above mantle lithosphere with $\delta V_S > 3.5\%$, a characteristic of cold cratonic regions [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The largest recorded earthquake in South Africa was the Ceres event of September 29, 1969, with magnitude $M_w$ 6.2, representing a 1.0 magnitude unit difference (32 times difference in seismic moment release) from the assigned $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$ [KB:epistemic.compile.md][WEB:https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1464343X19303449]. Paleoseismic evidence from stable continental regions globally indicates that prehistoric earthquakes may have greatly exceeded maximum observed instrumental magnitudes, with Australian SCR faults yielding $M_{\text{max}}$ estimates of $7.0-7.5 \pm 0.2$ based on multiple documented paleoearthquakes, and the Kango Fault paleoseismic evidence in South Africa demonstrating that $M_w$ 6.97-7.18 events are physically possible [KB:epistemic.compile.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph presents multiple technical claims about magnitude scaling, regional context, and cratonic constraints that are comprehensively supported by both KB sources and external research. The Wells and Coppersmith (1994) standard deviations (0.25-0.35), magnitude range calculation (6.85-7.55), and 64 km fault length are directly cited from KB:epistemic.compile.md and corroborated by the Wells-Coppersmith PDF reference. The external source on SCR-specific scaling relationships validates the caveat about different scaling in stable vs. active regions. Regional PSHA values (5.3-6.3 for most zones, 7.23 for Drakensberg, 7.0 for Kaapvaal) are explicitly stated in the KB. The cratonic constraint of $M_{c\text{max}} = 6.0$ and the $\delta V_S > 3.5\%$ threshold are directly from the KB citing Mooney et al. (2012). The Ceres earthquake magnitude ($M_w$ 6.2, September 29, 1969) and the 32-fold moment difference calculation are supported by both KB and the ScienceDirect PSHA reference. The Australian and Kango paleoseismic examples with their specific magnitude ranges are accurately cited from the KB. All quantitative values and comparative statements are traceable to cited sources.]

### Slip Rate Range and Logic Tree Development

No slip rate has been published for the Reitfontein Fault, with the assigned value of 1 m/Myr representing a conservative engineering assumption rather than empirical evidence [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. When slip rates are not quantified, they are estimated based on all other available data, and for bedrock faults that do not show evidence of movement in the last 10 million years but are included due to favorable orientation, a low uplift rate of 1 m/Myr is assigned [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Research indicates that fault slip rates in the order of 5-10 m/Myr in stable continental regions would be beneath the detection limit of cosmogenic radionuclide methods, suggesting 1 m/Myr represents an exceptionally slow slip rate at or below detection limits for many paleoseismic methods in SCR settings [KB:epistemic.compile.md][WEB:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281460177_Paleoseismicity_of_Two_Historically_Quiescent_Faults_in_Australia_Implications_for_Fault_Behavior_in_Stable_Continental_Regions]. Some of the more active faults in South Africa have slip rates on the order of 200 m/Myr, such as the Kango Fault, which is 200 times higher than Reitfontein's assigned rate yet produces similar maximum magnitudes [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The absence of quantified slip-rate data reflects the general paucity of paleoseismic studies on South African faults, and within intraplate environments, deformation is transient, occurring in discrete episodes separated by long hiatuses, with faults in stable continental regions exhibiting episodic behavior with recurrence intervals of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years between ground-rupturing events [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Cratonic faults in stable continental regions typically have long-term behavior characterized by episodes of activity separated by quiescent intervals of at least 10,000 and commonly 100,000 years or more, and the long-term slip rate on cratonic SCR faults is extremely low, making the geomorphic expression subtle and scarps difficult to detect because they are poorly preserved [WEB:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281460177_Paleoseismicity_of_Two_Historically_Quiescent_Faults_in_Australia_Implications_for_Fault_Behavior_in_Stable_Continental_Regions].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph's claims about slip rate absence, detection limits, and episodic behavior are well-supported by both KB and external sources. The KB:epistemic.compile.md explicitly states no slip rate has been published for Reitfontein and that 1 m/Myr is a conservative engineering assumption. The detection limit statement (5-10 m/Myr beneath cosmogenic radionuclide detection) is directly cited from the KB. The Kango Fault comparison (200 m/Myr, 200-fold difference) is accurately presented from KB data. The external web source on Australian SCR paleoseismicity corroborates the episodic behavior, long recurrence intervals (10,000-100,000+ years), extremely low slip rates, and poor geomorphic preservation characteristic of cratonic faults. The statement about transient deformation in discrete episodes is directly from the KB. All quantitative comparisons and temporal ranges are traceable to the cited sources with no invented values.]

### Seismic Event Probability in Return Periods Less Than 1/10,000 Years

To assess whether the slip rate range permits seismic movements in return periods less than 1/10,000 years (annual probability $> 10^{-4}$), the relationship between slip rate, earthquake magnitude, and recurrence interval must be considered using the characteristic earthquake model and Gutenberg-Richter recurrence relationship as the assessment framework [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The $M_{\text{max}}$ value primarily influences long-return-period hazard estimates (10,000 years and beyond) and deterministic scenario analyses, with disaggregation of the hazard showing that the majority of hazard comes from lower magnitudes for moderate return periods [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. For the Reitfontein Fault with $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$, the minimum magnitude $M_{\text{min}} = 5.7$, and for $M_{\text{max}}$ between 6.5 and 7.4, $M_{\text{min}} = M_{\text{max}} - 1.5$, yielding a range of 5.0 to 5.9 [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The Gutenberg-Richter equation is $\log_{10}(n) = a_0 - b \times M$, and for the Reitfontein Fault, three different b-values are employed: 1.35 (weighted 0.30), 1.10 (weighted 0.60), and 1.99 (weighted 0.10), with a lower b-value meaning that the ratio of large to small earthquakes is higher, increasing the probability of larger magnitude events [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Critical caveats must be considered: the complete lack of geological or geomorphological evidence for recent activity contradicts the slip rates ($\geq$ 1 m/Myr) that would produce observable surface deformation over Holocene timescales [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The $M_{c\text{max}} = 6.0$ constraint for cratonic interiors suggests that $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$ events may not be physically realizable regardless of return period, and SCR faults may have recurrence intervals of 100,000+ years with long periods of quiescence, making deterministic recurrence calculations highly uncertain [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The largest mining-related seismic event ever to occur in South Africa registered magnitude 5.3 on March 9, 2005, and mining-induced seismicity is highly unlikely to trigger rupture of the entire 64 km Reitfontein Fault, with most seismic events associated with mining being localized to the mining area and adjacent structures [KB:epistemic.compile.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph presents technical details about recurrence calculations, Gutenberg-Richter parameters, and various constraints that are fully supported by KB:epistemic.compile.md. The annual probability threshold ($> 10^{-4}$ for 1/10,000 year return period) and assessment framework are accurately cited. The magnitude relationships ($M_{\text{min}} = 5.7$ for $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$, and $M_{\text{min}} = M_{\text{max}} - 1.5$ for the 6.5-7.4 range) are explicitly stated in the KB. The Gutenberg-Richter equation and the three b-values with their specific weights (1.35/0.30, 1.10/0.60, 1.99/0.10) are directly cited. The interpretation of b-value effects on magnitude probability is accurately conveyed. The critical caveats about absence of neotectonic evidence, the $M_{c\text{max}} = 6.0$ cratonic constraint, episodic behavior with 100,000+ year recurrence, and mining seismicity limitations (magnitude 5.3 maximum, March 9, 2005 date, localization) are all precisely cited from the KB with no unsupported additions.]

### Gutenberg-Richter Parameters and b-value Logic Tree

The Gutenberg-Richter equation describes the frequency-magnitude distribution of earthquakes as $\log_{10}(n) = a_0 - b \times M$, where $b$ is the Richter b-value, $M$ is magnitude, and $n$ is the number of earthquakes, with a lower b-value meaning that the ratio of large to small earthquakes is higher, increasing the probability of larger magnitude events [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. For the Reitfontein Fault, three different b-values are employed: 1.35 (weighted 0.30), 1.10 (weighted 0.60), and 1.99 (weighted 0.10), with the dominant weight of 0.60 on the intermediate b-value of 1.10 suggesting this is the most representative value for the Reitfontein Fault [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The lower b-value of 1.35 with weight 0.30 increases the relative probability of larger magnitude events, while the high b-value of 1.99 with low weight of 0.10 represents a scenario where earthquake activity is dominated by smaller events [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The EZ-FRISK zones have b-values of 1.04 (Drakensberg) and 1.06 (Kaapvaal), which are consistent with the global average for tectonic earthquakes, while the Reitfontein Fault's central b-value of 1.10 is slightly higher than these regional values, and the weighted b-value of 1.35 is substantially higher [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Global and regional surveys show empirically determined b-values are remarkably stable, generally limited to values of $1 \pm 0.2$ (i.e., 0.8 to 1.2), with the Reitfontein values of 1.35 and 1.10 falling within or near this typical range, while the b-value of 1.99 (weight 0.10) is unusually high and represents a conservative scenario where small earthquakes dominate, making approach to $M_{\text{max}}$ highly improbable [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The PSHA study excludes events suspected of being mining-related with magnitudes less than M4.0 to minimize the influence of induced seismicity, with mining-induced seismicity falling into two main categories: collapsing of highly stressed rock masses and shear along geological planes of weakness [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Mining in the Witwatersrand Basin currently approaches depths of 4,000 meters, while in stable continental regions with thick lithosphere, seismogenic depths typically extend to 15-25 km, and the Reitfontein Fault is located 43 km from the South Deep Mine site [KB:epistemic.compile.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph presents detailed information about Gutenberg-Richter parameters and b-values that is comprehensively supported by KB:epistemic.compile.md. The equation form, definition of variables, and interpretation of b-value effects are accurately stated. The three b-values with their specific weights (1.35/0.30, 1.10/0.60, 1.99/0.10) and interpretations (most representative, increased large event probability, conservative small-event scenario) are directly cited from the KB. Regional comparisons with EZ-FRISK zones (1.04 Drakensberg, 1.06 Kaapvaal) and the characterization of 1.10 as slightly higher and 1.35 as substantially higher are explicitly stated in the KB. The empirically determined stability range ($1 \pm 0.2$, i.e., 0.8-1.2) and the classification of 1.99 as unusually high are directly from KB citing Meletlidis et al. (2014). The M4.0 exclusion threshold for mining events, the two categories of mining-induced seismicity, mining depth (4,000 m), seismogenic depth range (15-25 km), and distance to South Deep (43 km) are all precisely cited from the KB with no fabricated values or unsupported claims.]

## SLOT 2: Recommendations for Epistemic Uncertainty Treatment

### Logic Tree Weights for $M_{\text{max}}$

Given the substantial epistemic uncertainty surrounding the Reitfontein Fault's assigned $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$, a multi-branch logic tree approach is recommended to capture the range of scientifically defensible interpretations. A three-branch structure is proposed with weights reflecting the balance between conservative engineering practice and physical constraints from cratonic seismology. The first branch should maintain $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$ based on the Wells and Coppersmith (1994) 64 km fault-length scaling, assigned a weight of 0.25 to acknowledge this as the upper bound permitted by geometric scaling but tempered by the absence of neotectonic evidence [KB:epistemic.compile.md][WEB:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00024-022-03143-4]. The second branch should adopt $M_{\text{max}} = 6.5$ representing a reduction of 0.7 magnitude units to account for uncertainty in seismogenic versus mapped length and the possibility that stable continental region scaling relationships differ from the Wells-Coppersmith global dataset, assigned a weight of 0.50 as the central estimate balancing geometric potential against tectonic setting constraints [KB:epistemic.compile.md][WEB:https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/8755293020988024]. The third branch should implement $M_{\text{max}} = 6.0$ consistent with the Mooney et al. (2012) cratonic interior catalog maximum and the largest recorded South African earthquake ($M_w$ 6.2 Ceres, 1969), assigned a weight of 0.25 to reflect the physical constraint that no earthquakes with $M_w > 6$ have occurred above mantle lithosphere with $\delta V_S > 3.5\%$ characteristic of the Kaapvaal Craton [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. This weighting scheme (0.25, 0.50, 0.25) distributes epistemic uncertainty across a plausible magnitude range while centering probability on an intermediate value that acknowledges both fault geometry and cratonic constraints, and follows established PSHA practice of assigning highest weight to central estimates with symmetric lower weights to uncertainty bounds [WEB:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00024-022-03143-4].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: This paragraph presents a recommended three-branch logic tree structure for $M_{\text{max}}$ with specific weights (0.25/0.50/0.25) and magnitude values (7.2/6.5/6.0). The KB:epistemic.compile.md supports the physical basis for each branch: the 7.2 value from Wells-Coppersmith 64 km scaling, the absence of neotectonic evidence, the cratonic constraint of $M_{c\text{max}} = 6.0$ from Mooney et al. (2012), the Ceres earthquake magnitude ($M_w$ 6.2, 1969), and the $\delta V_S > 3.5\%$ threshold. The external sources on epistemic uncertainty in PSHA and SCR-specific scaling relationships validate the logic tree approach and the consideration of different scaling in stable vs. active regions. However, the specific weight values (0.25, 0.50, 0.25) and the intermediate magnitude of 6.5 represent a proposed recommendation rather than empirically derived values, though they follow the established PSHA practice of symmetric weights around a central estimate as noted in the logic tree literature. The rationale for each branch is well-grounded in cited evidence, but the exact numerical weights reflect expert judgment rather than direct citation, warranting MEDIUM confidence rather than HIGH.]

### Logic Tree Weights for Gutenberg-Richter Parameters

The current three-branch b-value implementation for the Reitfontein Fault (b = 1.35, weight 0.30; b = 1.10, weight 0.60; b = 1.99, weight 0.10) exhibits an unusual asymmetry with the highest b-value receiving minimal weight despite representing a plausible conservative bound [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. A revised weighting scheme is recommended to better reflect empirical constraints and standard practice in PSHA. The central b-value of 1.10 should be retained with weight 0.50, reduced from the current 0.60, as this value is slightly above the regional EZ-FRISK values (1.04 Drakensberg, 1.06 Kaapvaal) and close to the global average for tectonic earthquakes, representing the most likely characterization [KB:epistemic.compile.md][WEB:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00024-022-03143-4]. The lower b-value branch should be adjusted to b = 1.00 with weight 0.30, replacing the current 1.35 value, to align with regional values and represent a scenario where larger magnitude events have increased relative probability while remaining within the empirically observed range of $1 \pm 0.2$ for stable regions [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The upper b-value branch should be set to b = 1.30 with weight 0.20, replacing the current 1.99 value, to represent the conservative scenario where smaller events dominate while avoiding the physically implausible extreme of b = 1.99 which is far outside typical empirical ranges [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. This revised three-branch structure (b = 1.00/0.30, b = 1.10/0.50, b = 1.30/0.20) maintains coverage of the plausible b-value range while concentrating weight on values consistent with global and regional observations, follows the common PSHA practice of assigning weights of 0.2, 0.6, and 0.2 to (b minus sigma, mean b-value, b plus sigma) but adapted to reflect the specific epistemic uncertainty context of the Reitfontein Fault [WEB:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229025012_Testing_the_b-value_variability_in_Italy_and_its_influence_on_Italian_PSHA]. The a-value parameter in the Gutenberg-Richter relationship should be calibrated to match observed seismicity rates after filtering mining-related events with magnitudes less than M4.0, with epistemic uncertainty in the a-value captured through a minimum two-branch logic tree representing upper and lower bounds of the 95 percent confidence interval from catalog-based maximum likelihood estimation [KB:epistemic.compile.md].^[Verdict: UNCERTAIN, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: This paragraph presents a revised b-value weighting scheme and recommendations for a-value treatment. The KB:epistemic.compile.md provides the current b-value implementation (1.35/0.30, 1.10/0.60, 1.99/0.10), regional EZ-FRISK values (1.04, 1.06), and the empirical stability range ($1 \pm 0.2$, i.e., 0.8-1.2). The characterization of b = 1.99 as unusually high and the M4.0 mining exclusion threshold are directly from the KB. The external web source validates the common PSHA practice of 0.2/0.6/0.2 weighting for b-value uncertainty. However, the specific recommended values (b = 1.00/0.30, b = 1.10/0.50, b = 1.30/0.20) and their adjusted weights represent proposed recommendations not empirically derived from the sources, though they are informed by the cited empirical ranges and regional values. The rationale for each adjustment is grounded in cited evidence (alignment with regional values, staying within empirical ranges, avoiding extreme values), but the exact numerical choices reflect expert judgment rather than direct measurement. The a-value recommendation (two-branch logic tree, 95% confidence interval) is a methodological proposal consistent with PSHA practice but not specifically cited from the sources. The claims are well-reasoned and evidence-informed but involve proposed values rather than purely factual statements, warranting UNCERTAIN with MEDIUM confidence.]

### Consideration of Consistent Slip Rate

The assigned slip rate of 1 m/Myr for the Reitfontein Fault represents a conservative engineering assumption in the complete absence of published empirical measurements, and this value is at or below the detection limits of standard paleoseismic methods including cosmogenic radionuclide dating, which would be beneath detection for slip rates in the order of 5-10 m/Myr [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. Given the fundamental epistemic uncertainty in slip rate, a single-value assumption is inappropriate, and a three-branch logic tree structure is recommended to span the plausible range. The lower branch should adopt 0.1 m/Myr with weight 0.20, representing the scenario where the fault exhibits only rare episodic reactivation with recurrence intervals exceeding 100,000 years, consistent with the complete absence of observable neotectonic features and the fact that cratonic SCR faults commonly experience quiescent intervals of 100,000 years or more [KB:epistemic.compile.md][WEB:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281460177_Paleoseismicity_of_Two_Historically_Quiescent_Faults_in_Australia_Implications_for_Fault_Behavior_in_Stable_Continental_Regions]. The central branch should maintain 1.0 m/Myr with weight 0.60, preserving the current baseline assumption and reflecting that this value is the conventional assignment for bedrock faults that do not show evidence of movement in the last 10 million years but are included due to favorable orientation [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. The upper branch should implement 5.0 m/Myr with weight 0.20, representing a more active scenario while remaining well below the 200 m/Myr slip rate of documented active faults like Kango, and acknowledging that detection of slip rates below 5-10 m/Myr is methodologically challenging [KB:epistemic.compile.md]. This slip rate logic tree (0.1/0.20, 1.0/0.60, 5.0/0.20) should be cross-correlated with the $M_{\text{max}}$ logic tree such that higher slip rates pair with higher maximum magnitudes, implementing physical consistency where rapid strain accumulation supports larger seismic moment release. For the lowest slip rate branch (0.1 m/Myr), pair with $M_{\text{max}} = 6.0$; for the central slip rate (1.0 m/Myr), pair with $M_{\text{max}} = 6.5$; and for the upper slip rate (5.0 m/Myr), pair with $M_{\text{max}} = 7.2$, thereby ensuring that the combination of kinematic and geometric constraints remains physically plausible across the logic tree branches [WEB:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00024-022-03143-4].^[Verdict: UNCERTAIN, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: This paragraph presents a recommended three-branch slip rate logic tree structure and cross-correlation scheme with $M_{\text{max}}$. The KB:epistemic.compile.md supports several foundational claims: the 1 m/Myr value is a conservative engineering assumption lacking empirical measurements, it is at or below detection limits, 5-10 m/Myr is beneath cosmogenic radionuclide detection, the Kango Fault has 200 m/Myr, 1 m/Myr is conventionally assigned to bedrock faults without 10 Ma movement evidence, cratonic faults experience quiescent intervals of 100,000+ years, and there is complete absence of neotectonic features. The external web source on Australian SCR paleoseismicity corroborates the episodic reactivation and long quiescent intervals. However, the specific proposed slip rate values (0.1, 1.0, 5.0 m/Myr) and their weights (0.20, 0.60, 0.20) are recommendations informed by but not directly measured from the cited sources. The cross-correlation scheme pairing slip rates with $M_{\text{max}}$ values (0.1 with 6.0, 1.0 with 6.5, 5.0 with 7.2) represents a methodological proposal for physical consistency validated by the logic tree literature but not empirically derived. While the rationale for each branch is grounded in cited evidence (detection limits, conventional assignments, absence of features, comparison with active faults), the exact numerical choices reflect expert judgment. The recommendations are scientifically defensible and evidence-informed but involve proposed values rather than purely factual citations, warranting UNCERTAIN with MEDIUM confidence.]
