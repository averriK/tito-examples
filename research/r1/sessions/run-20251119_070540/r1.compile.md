# Comparative Analysis of PGA Values and GMPE Methodologies in PSHA Studies for South Africa

## Executive Summary

Probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) for the South Deep Gold Mine site at Doornpoort has evolved significantly, with recent studies reporting substantially higher peak ground acceleration (PGA) values than previously adopted. The Seismology Research Centre (SRC) 2025 study estimated a mean PGA of 0.33 g for a 475-year return period and 1.3 g for a 10,000-year return period, compared to previously adopted values of 0.15 g and 0.25 g, respectively [@SRC2025]. This increase reflects methodological advances including the incorporation of epistemic uncertainty through logic trees, refined source models, and selection of appropriate ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs) for stable continental regions.

## 1. Benchmark Comparison of PGA Values

### 1.1 Historical Evolution of PGA Estimates

The estimation of PGA for the Witwatersrand region has progressed considerably over three decades. The Global Seismic Hazard Assessment Program (GSHAP, 1992-1999) estimated PGA values below 0.01 g for a 475-year return period [@SRC2025]. Subsequent studies by Midzi et al. (2020) calculated values between 0.1 and 0.16 g, while the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) 2019 study reported a range of 0.2 to 0.35 g [@SRC2025][@GEM_GlobalMap]. The most recent GEM 2023 model estimates PGA between 0.35 and 0.55 g for the same return period [@SRC2025][@GEM_GlobalMap].

The GEM Global Seismic Hazard Map (version 2023.1) represents the spatial distribution of PGA with 10% probability of exceedance in 50 years, calculated for reference rock conditions with $V_{s30}$ between 760 and 800 m/s [@GEM_GlobalMap]. For South Africa, the map shows PGA values ranging from 0.017 g to 0.149 g, with elevated hazard in gold mining regions [@GEM_GlobalMap].

### 1.2 SRC 2025 Study Results

The SRC study employed three seismic source models: the EZ-FRISK Africa model (developed by William Lettis & Associates, 2008), the GEM South Africa (ZAF) model (updated by Midzi et al., 2020 from the Council for Geoscience), and a smoothed seismicity model developed specifically for the site [@SRC2025]. The equally weighted mean of these three models produces the final PGA estimates.

**Table 1.** PGA values (g) for different return periods according to three source models and weighted mean. Site conditions: $V_{s30} = 600$ m/s, $M_w \geq 5.0$ [@SRC2025].

| Return Period (years) | EZF Model | GEM Model | Smoothed Model | Weighted Mean |
|-----------------------|-----------|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| 250                   | 0.106     | 0.398     | 0.071          | 0.220         |
| 475                   | 0.157     | 0.564     | 0.103          | 0.329         |
| 1,000                 | 0.236     | 0.799     | 0.154          | 0.498         |
| 2,000                 | 0.335     | 1.067     | 0.216          | 0.696         |
| 5,000                 | 0.516     | 1.501     | 0.325          | 1.028         |
| 10,000                | 0.696     | 1.892     | 0.432          | 1.328         |

The GEM model consistently produces the highest PGA values among the three models, while the smoothed seismicity model generates the most conservative estimates [@SRC2025]. This variation reflects fundamental differences in methodology: the EZF model uses regional area sources, the GEM model incorporates 11 area sources with variable parameters, and the smoothed model relies exclusively on the historical earthquake catalog with 50 km radial smoothing [@SRC2025].

### 1.3 Epistemic Uncertainty Analysis

The epistemic uncertainty in PGA predictions demonstrates substantial variability. For the 475-year return period, the 15th percentile is 0.086 g, the 50th percentile (median) is 0.136 g, and the 85th percentile is 0.581 g, representing a range of variation approaching an order of magnitude [@SRC2025]. This dispersion underscores the critical importance of GMPE selection and the necessity of incorporating multiple models through logic trees to adequately capture epistemic uncertainty in the absence of local attenuation data [@SRC2025].

### 1.4 Factors Contributing to Increased PGA Estimates

The progressive increase in PGA estimates over time is attributed primarily to three factors: (1) selection of more appropriate ground motion models for the region, (2) explicit incorporation of epistemic uncertainty through logic trees, and (3) refinement of seismic source models based on more complete data [@SRC2025]. SRC notes that differences between the selected ground motion models and the inclusion of uncertainty are likely the most significant causes of differences with previous studies [@SRC2025].

A major deficiency of ground motion attenuation data exists in the study area [@SRC2025]. Until local ground motion models can be derived, functions from areas with similar geology must be employed. The Australian National Committee on Large Dams (ANCOLD) guidelines recommend using multiple source models to capture epistemic uncertainty [@SRC2025]. The inclusion of uncertainty commonly leads to increases in seismic hazard estimates [@SRC2025].

## 2. Ground Motion Prediction Equations: Logic Tree Approaches

### 2.1 USGS Logic Tree: NGA-East Models for Stable Continental Crust

The USGS logic tree employs exclusively models derived from the NGA-East (Next Generation Attenuation for Eastern North America) project, designed specifically for stable continental crust regions [@USGS_LT][@PEER_NGAEast]. This tree comprises 23 models: 17 Sammons models (NGAEastUSGSSammons1 through NGAEastUSGSSammons17) with a total weight of 0.667, and 6 seed models (Graizer16, Graizer17, Frankel, YA15, PZCT15_M1SS, PZCT15_M2ES) with a total weight of 0.333 [@USGS_LT].

The Sammons models represent a sampled set that captures the center, body, and range of ground motion predictions for the Central and Eastern North America (CENA) region, a stable cratonic region analogous to South Africa [@USGS_LT]. The NGA-East project developed these models using the largest database of recorded ground motions in stable continental regions (SCR), with more than 29,000 records from 81 seismic events ($M > 2.5$) and 1,379 recording stations, spanning distances up to 1,500 km [@NGAEast_Report].

The NGA-East models are applicable to moment magnitudes $M_w$ between 4.0 and 8.2, rupture distances $R_{rup}$ from 0 to 1,500 km, and are calibrated for very hard rock conditions with shear wave velocity $V_s = 3,000$ m/s [@NGAEast_Report]. The models were developed through a Senior Seismic Hazard Analysis Committee (SSHAC) process to provide the best estimate of the distribution of average horizontal ground motions (PGA, PGV, and 5%-damped spectral response for periods 0.01-10 s) at hard rock sites [@PEER_NGAEast].

CENA regions represent stable continental crust with rare but significant seismicity [@PEER_NGAEast]. The models were calibrated specifically for regions where tectonic activity is relatively low compared to plate boundary regions, presenting attenuation characteristics different from tectonically active zones [@PEER_NGAEast][@NGAEast_EESD].

### 2.2 SHM6 Logic Tree: Canadian Hybrid Approach

The SHM6 logic tree is based on the sixth generation Canadian Seismic Hazard Model (CanadaSHM6) and employs NGA-East models adapted for Canada, calibrated for stable continental crust [@SHM6_LT]. This tree employs a hybrid approach with 16 branches combining 13 CanadaSHM6_StableCrust_NGAEast submodels (submodels 01-13) and 3 branches of CanadaSHM6_StableCrust_AA13 (Atkinson-Abrahamson 2013) with high, central, and low variants [@SHM6_LT].

A distinctive feature of the SHM6 model is its period-dependent weighting scheme, where the weights assigned to each GMPE vary according to the intensity measure type (IMT), including PGA, PGV, and spectral accelerations for periods between 0.05 s and 10.0 s [@SHM6_LT]. For example, submodel 01 has a weight of 0.0757 for PGA, 0.0682 for PGV, and variable weights for different spectral periods. The three Atkinson-Abrahamson 2013 models have weights of 0.15 (high), 0.25 (central), and 0.10 (low), representing epistemic uncertainty in ground motion predictions [@SHM6_LT].

The CanadaSHM6 model forms the basis for proposed seismic design values for the 2020 edition of the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC 2020) [@SHM6_LT][@NRCAN_CanadaSHM6]. For eastern Canada, where only stable crust sources exist, all contributions are of this type, treating eastern Canada as a stable continental region for seismic hazard purposes [@SHM6_LT][@NRCAN_CanadaSHM6].

### 2.3 GEM Logic Tree: Active Crustal Models Applied to Stable Region

The GEM logic tree presents a fundamentally different configuration, employing only three GMPEs originally calibrated for active shallow crustal (ASC) regions rather than models specific to stable continental crust: Abrahamson et al. 2014 (ASK14), Chiou & Youngs 2014 (CY14), both from the NGA-West2 project, and Akkar-Cagnan 2010 [@GEM_LT]. The three models receive nearly equal weights, resulting in the simplest logic tree structure among the three analyzed [@GEM_LT].

The ASK14 and CY14 models were developed in the NGA-West2 project using more than 12,000 records from over 300 earthquakes in active tectonic regions, with specific calibration for California, Japan, China, and Taiwan [@ASK14_Paper]. The ASK14 model is applicable to magnitudes $M_w$ between 3.0 and 8.5, distances up to 300 km, and spectral periods from 0 to 10 s, with regional adjustments reflecting differences in attenuation at large distances and $V_{s30}$ scaling between regions [@ASK14_Paper]. The CY14 model has similar applicability ranges ($M_w$ 3.0 to 7.9, $R_{rup}$ up to 300 km), also with regional parameterization for the same active tectonic zones [@SRC2025].

The Akkar-Cagnan 2010 model was developed from an extended Turkish database and showed that NGA-West1 GMPEs and ground motion predictive models from pan-European datasets would yield conservative estimates with respect to their GMPE [@Springer_AkkarCagnan]. This model provides regional representation for active crustal regions in Europe and the Middle East [@Springer_AkkarCagnan][@AkkarCagnan_Chapter].

This selection of models for the GEM tree represents a notable methodological incongruity: the three GMPEs are calibrated for active tectonic environments characterized by high crustal deformation rates and elevated seismic frequency, while South Africa is classified as a stable continental region (SCR) with low deformation rates and moderate seismic activity [@SRC2025]. However, this choice is defensible under the argument of Midzi et al. (2020) that ASC models may be appropriate for the Witwatersrand region due to the absence of locally derived attenuation models from sufficient regional data [@SRC2025].

## 3. GMPEs Employed by SRC: Combined Stable and Active Crustal Approach

The SRC study employed five GMPEs with equal weighting (0.20 each), combining three models calibrated for stable continental regions (SCR) with two models for active shallow crustal (ASC) regions [@SRC2025]. This methodological strategy follows the approach adopted by GEM in the Midzi et al. (2020) model, based on the scarcity of local attenuation data for South Africa [@SRC2025].

### 3.1 Stable Continental Region Models

The three selected SCR models represent developments for eastern North America, a region geologically analogous to South Africa due to its stable craton condition [@SRC2025].

#### 3.1.1 Atkinson-Boore (2006) ENA

The Atkinson-Boore (2006) model was derived for Eastern North America (ENA), a stable continental region [@SRC2025]. This is an SCR model applicable in areas where seismicity and tectonic regime are considered stable. The model is applicable for magnitudes in the range $4.0 \leq M_w \leq 8.0$, distances up to 1000 km ($0 \leq R_{rup} \leq 1000$ km), and site conditions with shear wave velocities in the first 30 m ($V_{s30}$) of 180-2000 m/s [@SRC2025].

The ENA model is appropriate for regions where cold, hard, and/or ancient rocks transmit seismic waves without absorbing significant energy, a characteristic typical of stable continental regions [@SRC2025]. Atkinson and Boore subsequently compared their ground motion prediction equations for eastern North America with newly available ground motion data and suggested revisions that are simple modifications to the existing equations, significantly improving their agreement with the data [@AB06_OpenQuake].

#### 3.1.2 Goulet et al. (2018) NGA-East

The Goulet et al. (2018) model is an NGA model for Central and Eastern North America (CENA), developed as part of the NGA-East project [@SRC2025]. This model is applicable for magnitudes $4.0 \leq M_w \leq 8.2$, rupture distances 0 to 1,500 km, and is calibrated for site conditions with $V_{s30}$ of approximately 3000 m/s [@SRC2025]. This model consistently contributed the highest values among the five GMPEs employed [@SRC2025].

The NGA-East project was a major research initiative to create new ground motion prediction equations for stable continental regions [@NGAEast_EESD]. Unlike the western United States where an active tectonic environment exists, the stable continental environment in the central and eastern United States has insufficient strong motion records to create purely empirical GMPEs, so the project extensively used simulations [@NGAEast_EESD]. A limitation of the NGA-East model is that it was not developed for use with magnitudes less than 4, requiring an extension that extrapolates the small magnitude scaling of ground motions [@USGS_ShakeMap].

#### 3.1.3 Pezeshk et al. (2011)

The Pezeshk et al. (2011) model was developed for Western North America (WNA) using $V_{s30}$ values of 620 m/s and also has a function for Eastern North America for $V_{s30} \geq 2000$ m/s [@SRC2025]. This model is applicable for SCR regions with magnitudes $5.0 \leq M_w \leq 8.0$, Joyner-Boore distances $1 \leq R_{JB} \leq 1000$ km, and site conditions with $V_{s30}$ of 620-2000 m/s [@SRC2025].

Pezeshk, Zandieh, and Tavakoli (2011) developed hybrid empirical ground motion prediction equations for eastern North America using NGA models and updated seismological parameters, published in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America [@SRC2025][@Pezeshk_Review].

### 3.2 Active Shallow Crustal Models

The two ASC models come from the NGA-West2 project and were developed with data from global active tectonic regions [@SRC2025].

#### 3.2.1 Boore et al. (2014) NGA-West2

The Boore et al. (2014) NGA-West2 model is one of five models developed in the NGA-West2 project [@SRC2025]. This model was derived using 19,000 additional three-component records over extended magnitude and distance ranges. The model is applicable for active shallow crustal regions worldwide (ASC), with magnitudes $3.0 \leq M_w \leq 7.9$, Joyner-Boore distances $0 \leq R_{JB} \leq 400$ km, and site conditions with $V_{s30}$ of 150-1500 m/s [@SRC2025].

The NGA-West2 models were calculated for a series of different damping factors (0.5-30%, compared to only 5% damping in previous versions) and an extension to long periods from 10 seconds to 20 seconds [@SRC2025]. These models include region-specific regression coefficient terms that explain regional differences in ground motions [@SRC2025].

#### 3.2.2 Chiou & Youngs (2014) NGA-West2

The Chiou-Youngs (2014) NGA-West2 model is another of the five models from the NGA-West2 project [@SRC2025]. It is applicable for active shallow crustal regions worldwide, with magnitudes $3.0 \leq M_w \leq 7.9$, rupture distances $0 \leq R_{rup} \leq 300$ km, and site conditions with $V_{s30}$ of 180-1500 m/s [@SRC2025].

Like other NGA-West2 models, the Chiou-Youngs model was developed under the assumption that median ground motions in active crustal regions are similar worldwide at distances less than approximately 80 km [@SRC2025][@SagePub_NGAWest2]. The model incorporates region-specific regression coefficients for different active tectonic regions [@SRC2025][@SagePub_NGAWest2].

### 3.3 Methodological Implementation

A comparative analysis of the five GMPEs shows that both NGA-West2 models derived for ASC regions produce lower ground motions than the three employed SCR models, with the Goulet et al. (2018) NGA-East model generating the highest estimates [@SRC2025]. The dispersion in ground motion estimates among the five models reflects the fundamental epistemic uncertainty about attenuation rates in the study area, given the absence of locally derived ground motion models from sufficient regional data [@SRC2025].

The methodological implementation employed equal weighting (0.20) for the five GMPEs, thus capturing epistemic uncertainty without a priori favoring any specific model [@SRC2025]. The EZ-FRISK software was used for hazard calculation, with truncation of aleatory variability at the limit of $4\sigma$ [@SRC2025]. The adopted site parameters were $V_{s30} = 600$ m/s (minimum value for engineering rock, NEHRP Class C classification), depth to $V_s = 1,000$ m/s of $Z_{1.0} = 0.1$ km (calculated according to Abrahamson & Silva, 2008), and depth to $V_s = 2,500$ m/s of $Z_{2.5} = 0.35$ km (calculated according to Campbell & Bozorgnia, 2014) [@SRC2025].

Unless otherwise stated, the minimum magnitude used in calculations was $M_w$ 5.0 [@SRC2025]. All results in the SRC report were calculated using the EZ-FRISK software package supplied by Fugro USA Land, Inc. [@SRC2025]. The three earthquake recurrence models were all equally weighted in the hazard computation process [@SRC2025].

## 4. Regional Tectonic Context and Methodological Justification

South Africa is generally considered a stable continental region due to its relative position to plate boundaries, low level of seismic activity, and slow rates of crustal deformation [@SRC2025][@GEM_OpenQuake]. However, the earthquake catalog for South Africa includes events generated by mining activity around the Witwatersrand Basin, which introduces unique mining-induced seismic characteristics that must be considered in seismic hazard analysis [@SRC2025][@GEM_OpenQuake].

South Africa is located on the passive southern margin of the African continent, where it transitions to oceanic crust [@SRC2025]. It is situated in a stable continental region and has relatively low tectonic activity compared to countries located near plate boundaries. However, several moderate to large earthquakes have been recorded in South Africa [@SRC2025].

Midzi presents a compelling argument that active shallow crustal (ASC) ground motion models may be appropriate, which is why SRC included ground motion models derived for both ASC and SCR, with a total of five models to better capture epistemic uncertainty [@SRC2025]. The analysis shows that both NGA-West2 models derived for ASC regions provide lower ground motions than the three SCR models used, with the most recent Goulet et al. 2018 NGA-East SCR model contributing the highest values [@SRC2025]. The dispersion of ground motion estimates is a reflection of the uncertainty surrounding attenuation rates in the area, and the inclusion of the selected models is justifiable given this uncertainty [@SRC2025].

## 5. Comparative Synthesis and Conclusions

The comparison of different approaches for GMPE selection in PSHA studies for South Africa reveals two contrasting methodological philosophies [@SRC2025][@USGS_LT][@SHM6_LT][@GEM_LT]. The USGS and SHM6 models employ exclusively GMPEs calibrated for stable continental regions (SCR), recognizing South Africa's tectonic classification as a stable craton with low deformation rates [@USGS_LT][@SHM6_LT][@SRC2025]. In contrast, the GEM and SRC models combine active crustal (ASC) GMPEs with SCR models, based on the argument that the absence of local data justifies exploring multiple classes of models [@GEM_LT][@SRC2025].

The evolution of PGA estimates for the Witwatersrand area from values below 0.01 g (GSHAP 1992-1999) to values between 0.33 and 0.55 g (SRC 2025, GEM 2023) reflects both methodological refinement in the incorporation of epistemic uncertainty and the maturation of knowledge about seismic wave propagation in stable continental regions [@SRC2025][@GEM_GlobalMap]. The appropriate selection of GMPEs, preferably through logic trees that include multiple models calibrated for analogous SCR regions (eastern North America, central Australia), represents a determining factor for obtaining reliable seismic hazard estimates in South Africa [@SRC2025][@NGAEast_Report].

The significant increase from previously adopted values (0.15 g and 0.25 g for return periods of 475 and 10,000 years) to the current estimates (0.33 g and 1.3 g) raises important concerns regarding the impact on the design of underground structures and stability evaluation at the mine [@SRC2025]. The wide range of epistemic uncertainty, with the 85th percentile nearly seven times higher than the 15th percentile for the 475-year return period, underscores the critical importance of carefully considered GMPE selection and the systematic incorporation of multiple models through logic trees.
