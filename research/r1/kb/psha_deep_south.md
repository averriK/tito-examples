RE: South Deep Gold Mine: Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Assessment

SLR Consulting (South Africa) (Pty.) Ltd. (SLR) was requested by South Deep Gold Mine
(South Deep) to develop a site-specific Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Assessment (PSHA) for
the South Deep TSFs. This exercise was conducted to:
   •        Conform with GISTM requirements
   •        Provide an improved site-specific seismic characterisation, compared to that adopted
            in the 2008/2009 design of the Doornpoort TSF.
The PSHA work is presented in the Seismology Research Centre (SRC) report entitled “South
Deep Gold Mine, Seismic hazard Assessment – June 2025 (Draft Report)”, the results of which
are summarised below (the full report is appended to this letter for reference):
            This study focuses on earthquake hazard resulting from ground shaking, excluding
            secondary seismic hazards such as surface rupture, liquefaction, landslides, seiche,
            tsunami, and subsidence. Seismic hazard calculations were conducted using the
            equally weighted average of three seismic source models: two regional models—EZ-
            FRISK’s Africa model and the Global Earthquake Model’s (GEM) Africa (ZAF) model—
            and a smoothed seismicity model developed by SRC staff member Russell
            Cuthbertson. All three models incorporate fault sources.
            The study utilised five Ground Motion Prediction Equations (GMPEs), comprising two
            models appropriate for active shallow crustal regions (Boore et al., 2014; Chiou &
            Youngs, 2014) and three models suited to stable continental regions (Atkinson &
            Boore, 2006; Goulet et al., 2018; Pezeshk et al., 2011). Probabilistic hazard curves
            were developed for peak ground acceleration (PGA) and spectral response (with a 5%
            damping ratio), applying a minimum considered magnitude of 5.0.

        For the Doornpoort site, the PGA for a 475-year return period (10% probability of
        exceedance in 50 years) is estimated at 0.33 g, while the PGA for a 10,000-year return
        period is calculated as 1.3 g, assuming a Vs₃₀ value of 600 m/s. Previous assessments
        using different methodologies and input data produced PGA estimates ranging from
        0.1 g to 0.55 g for the 475-year return period.
It is noted that the PGA values that were adopted in past analyses, based on available
information at that time, were as follows:
    •   0.15g for the 475-year return period (10% probability of exceedance in 50 years), and
    •   0.25g for the 10,000-year return period.
It is noted that the PGA values presented by SRC are considerably higher than the previously
adopted PGA values. There is a concern that the adoption of these latest SRC PGA values
will impact significantly on any stability and deformation analyses (and QRAs) which ultimately
feeds into the type and extent of any remediation measures that may be required to manage
such large ground motions i.e. the adoption of larger PGAs is likely to increase possible
remedial works.


Given the above and since this is a very specialised subject, SLR recommends that:
    •   A third-party review is undertaken on the SRC PHSA work.
    •   The above-mentioned third-party reviewer should comment on the influence of mining-
        related seismicity on the modelling and the resultant PGA values.


Kindly contact the undersigned should you have any further queries.

SEISMIC HAZARD ASSESSMENT




             A division of ESS Earth Sciences Pty Ltd, ACN 006 058 395
Executive Summary

 A site-specific seismic hazard study has been produced for South Deep Gold Mine, South Africa.


 A Vs30 value of 600 m/s has been used for the computation of the ground motion recurrence results
 presented in this report.


 This report primarily considers the earthquake hazard arising from ground shaking. Secondary
 earthquake-related hazards, such as surface rupture, subsidence, liquefaction, landslides, seiche and
 tsunami, have not been considered.


 Calculations for this study were carried out using the equal weighted mean of three models; two regional
 models (EZ-FRISK’s Africa model and the Global Earthquake Model’s (GEM) Africa (ZAF) model) and a
 smoothed seismicity model by SRC staff member Russell Cuthbertson. Fault sources are considered in
 all three models.


 Five ground motion models have been selected and weighted for this study; two for active shallow crust
 regions (Boore at al., 2014; Chiou & Youngs, 2014) and three for stable continental regions (Atkinson
 & Boore, 2006; Goulet et al. (2018) NGA-East; Pezeshk et al., 2011).


 Probabilistic hazard curves for PGA and response spectra (for 5% damping) are presented.


 A minimum magnitude of 5.0 has been used in the hazard calculations presented.


 Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) levels for the Doornport (New Facility) site for a 475-year return period
 (10% probability of exceedance in 50 years) is calculated to be 0.33 g and for a 10,000 year return
 period is 1.3 g, when considering earthquakes of magnitude 5.0 or greater and a Vs30 value of 600 m/s.


 Previous studies (using different input and analysis) produced PGA estimates of between 0.1 g and
 0.55 g for a 475-year (10% in 50 years) return period.

1         Introduction

1.1       Outline
This seismic hazard assessment of South Deep Gold Mine, South Africa, has been produced for SLR
Consulting (reference Drian Roos) by the Seismology Research Centre (SRC), a division of ESS Earth
Sciences Pty Ltd (ESS). There are two sites of interest for the South Deep Gold Mine:


          Doornport (New Facility) (27.4602°S, longitude 27.6501°E)
          South Deep (Four Old Dams) (27.4172°S, longitude 27.6734°E)


This seismic hazard assessment (see Section 6) uses as inputs:

          Models of the seismicity of the area

          Fault sources

          Ground motion models

The majority of this report details the analysis used to determine the hazard at the sites in terms of
hazard curves (Section 9).


This report considers the hazard from ground shaking. This is a desktop study and other earthquake-
related hazards, such as surface deformation, subsidence, liquefaction, seiche and landslides, have not
been considered.


1.2       Earthquake Recurrence Models

Calculations for this study are carried out using the weighted mean of three models; two regional models
(EZ-FRISK’s Africa model and the Global Earthquake Model’s (GEM) South Africa (ZAF) model) and a
smoothed seismicity model by SRC staff member Russell Cuthbertson. The EZ-FRISK-Africa model was
developed by William Lettis & Associates, Inc (WLA) (2008) to support hazard and risk modelling being
conducted by Risk Engineering, Inc (REI); this model is available through the EZ-FRISK software package
as used for calculations in this study. The initial version of the South Africa (ZAF) model was developed
by scientists from the Council for Geoscience, South Africa and the Indian Institute of Technology, Jammu,
India (Midzi et al., 2020). The latest version was updated and improved by the Global Earthquake Model
(GEM) Team and has been applied in this study. The South Deep smoothed seismicity model was
developed specifically for use in this study by SRC staff member Russell Cuthbertson. Each of these
models has been equally weighted in the results.


There may be other models of South Africa seismicity available, however we have selected the above
three models as a pragmatic approach. In our opinion the three models used in this report are well
researched and derived approaches, and are likely to capture the centre, body and range of epistemic
uncertainty involved in the PSHA process.

1.3       Ground Motion Models
Ground Motion Models (see Section 5) equate ground motion from an earthquake to distance and
magnitude as well as incorporating some other factors such as site conditions.


The equations estimate ground motion in a range of forms: peak ground acceleration (PGA), peak ground
velocity (PGV), intensity (MMI) and response spectra (see Appendix F).


1.4       Site Conditions

Seismic waves arriving from an earthquake are modified by the local site conditions due to a range of
effects including impedance, attenuation, resonance, reflection and wave conversion. These effects and
the manner in which they are treated in Ground Motion Models are described in more detail in
Appendix G.


The Next Generation Attenuation ground motion models used in this study consider the shear wave
velocity to a depth of 30 metres (Vs30) as a proxy measure to estimate site response in a general sense
based on the manner in which earthquake ground motions recorded at other sites with a similar Vs30
have responded to earthquake shaking. They are applicable for values ranging from 150 to 1500 m/s.
Beyond 1500 m/s there is negligible impedance amplification.


A Vs30 value of 600 m/s has been used for the computation of the ground motion values. This value was
provided by SLR Consulting (D. Roos, pers comm., 2024). Under normal circumstances we would consider
a Vs30 of 600 m/s as the minimum value for “engineering bedrock”, below which there may be site
specific non-linear effects if there are significant residual soil deposits beneath the structure. The ground
motion models used in this study apply Vs30 as a proxy measure for site response. This means the results
presented here will represent the average way in which strong ground motions recorded at sites with
similar Vs30 values have behaved. Additional analysis that specifically models the non-linear effect of soil
deposits (if present) at the site could be carried out using these results, or results computed for a
reference bedrock unit Vs30 as an input.


1.5       Outputs
Results of the hazard analysis are presented principally as hazard curves (see Section 9). See Appendix
E for a description of the terminology relating to probabilities and return periods.


Hazard curves are presented for:


          Peak ground acceleration (PGA)

          Horizontal response spectra


See Appendix F for a description of these parameters.


In addition, conditional mean spectra (CMS), disaggregation plots and hazard fractile plots are presented
to describe the nature of the seismic hazard at the site and to quantify the uncertainty related to the
presented hazard estimates.

2     Previous Hazard Studies
The Global Seismic Hazard Assessment Program, which operated from 1992 to 1999, was a program
under the United Nations International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction framework. It produced
hazard estimates on a global scale for 10% probability of exceedance in 50 years (475-year return
period). The hazard estimates for the study area (in g) are shown in Figure 1. The GSHAP hazard
estimate for the site is less than 0.01 g.




                                                      11

The differences between the values calculated in this report and the previous estimates can be due to a
range of reasons such as using Ground Motion Models that are now considered obsolete and using just a
single earthquake recurrence source model. The values calculated in this current study use more modern
and updated attenuation models as well as three earthquake recurrence models in order to capture the
epistemic uncertainty.


A detailed discussion comparing the results of previous studies with the hazard results computed for this
study is presented in Section 10.

3      Seismicity

3.1    Seismicity of the study area
Most earthquakes within a plate or at divergent or horizontal strike-slip plate boundaries are constrained
to the upper crust, with magnitudes normally not exceeding 7.5 to 8.0. At convergent plate boundaries
the much larger rupture area can result in larger earthquakes up to about magnitude 9.5. Almost all
earthquakes larger than magnitude 8.5 occur on subduction zones.


South Africa sits at the southern passive margin of the African continent, where it transitions into oceanic
crust (Midzi et al., 2019). It is in a stable continental region and has relatively low tectonic activity when
compared to countries situated near plate boundaries. However, several moderate to large earthquakes
have been recorded in South Africa.


3.2    Seismograph Network

The first seismograph in South Africa was installed in 1899 at the Royal Observatory in Cape Town (Midzi
et al., 2020).


World seismograph coverage improved dramatically in 1960, following the International Geophysical Year
during 1957-1958. All larger earthquakes in South Africa would be have then also been detected by the
global network, initially over magnitude 5.0, and recently over a magnitude slightly less than 4.0 in some
regions.


In 1970 the Council of Geoscience (CGS) established the South African National Seismograph Network
(SANSN). Along with this network they now operate and maintain three networks for the Mine Health and
Safety Council (MHSC); the Klerksdorp–Orkney–Stilfontein–Hartebeesfontein (KOSH) network, the
Central Basin Area network and the Far West Rand Area network.


Figure 4 shows the seismographs in the study region that currently supply data to the Incorporated
Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) (IRIS, 2024), which mainly consists of SANSN stations, along
with the CSG MHSC stations.

3.3   Earthquake Catalogue Completeness

The quality of an earthquake catalogue depends on the number, type and distribution of recording
instruments, how long they have been installed, and on the noise level at each site.


The minimum magnitude for which an earthquake catalogue will be complete varies with time and
location. Prior to the installation of a satisfactory seismograph network, the minimum magnitude depends
on the distribution of the population and the presence of a system for reporting and storing earthquake
                                                           15

information. Where a seismograph network has been installed, its coverage depends on the distribution
and sensitivity of the seismographs.


3.4   Earthquake Catalogues

The earthquake catalogue used in this study is primarily based on the Council of Geoscience’s (CGS)
South African National Seismic Network catalogue (SANSN, network code: PRE), which includes events
from 1620 to 2019, as well as the ISC Comprehensive Catalogue (ISC, 2025), which includes the Council
of Geoscience (PRE) data, plus data and results provided by many other authorities, including the
Botswana Geoscience Institute (BGSI), Goetz Observatory (BUL) in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, East African
Network (EAF), International Data Centre (IDC), the Geological Survey of Namibia (NAM) and the National
Earthquake Information Center (NEIC). The ISC merged data revision occurs after two years and in this
case covers the period to 31 December 2022.


We followed the approach by Midzi et al. (2020) and retained events larger than Mw 4 located within the
mining region in the catalogue as such events have caused damage underground and also on the surface
(Midzi etal., 2020). All events identified with a mine placename, located within the mining regions and
below Mw 4 were removed from the project catalogue.


3.5   Seismicity Maps

Prior to the installation of seismographs, earthquakes large enough and near to centres of populated
regions were much more likely to be reported than smaller earthquakes or those in remote areas.
Therefore, plots of historical earthquake epicentres can give a misleading bias towards moderate to large
earthquakes occurring in populated areas. The improvements in the world seismograph network in the
1960s allowed smaller events and those in more remote areas to be detected.


Figure 5 shows those earthquakes reported in the region. The relative number of earthquakes shown in
this figure is not necessarily an indication of the earthquake hazard. The earthquake catalogue shows the
area surrounding the site to be high in recorded seismicity.


Table 1 lists all earthquakes exceeding magnitude 4 that occurred within 100 km of the South Deep Gold
Mine sites (listed in distance order), from the SANSN & ISC Catalogues.

3.6   Induced Seismicity
Earthquakes triggered by human activity that alters the stresses and strains within the Earth’s crust are
referred to as induced seismicity. The largest known induced seismic event was of magnitude mb 7.1
arising from an underground nuclear test in 1971 (Goldblat et al., 1988). A comprehensive quantitative
analysis of the potential for Doornport (New Facility) for induced seismicity is beyond the scope of this
document, however a number of qualitative observations are outlined below.


3.6.1 Reservoir Triggered

Reservoir triggered seismicity (RTS) is a phenomenon associated with new dams and may be an issue for
reservoir depths greater than 100 m or volumes larger than 500 Mm3. ICOLD (2012) identifies six cases
where reservoir triggered seismicity has generated events larger than M 5.7 with the largest event being
the Koyna event of magnitude M 6.3. There is some speculation that the Mw 7.9 Wenchuan, Sichuan,
China earthquake may have been a reservoir triggered event, however there is no definitive conclusion
at this time. The potential maximum magnitude of RTS is difficult to quantify.

            250610 South Deep Seismicity Study.docx                        Publish Date: 10/06/2025
3.6.2 Other induced seismicity

In addition to reservoir impoundment, seismicity arising from human activity has been recognised as
arising from nuclear tests, mining activity, waste disposal wells, hydrocarbon extraction and storage,
groundwater extraction, geothermal energy production, hydraulic fracturing and carbon capture and
storage.


Mining induced seismicity depends on depth, stress within the surrounding rock, mining method and
extraction sequence and geometry. Mine blasts or explosions are not normally considered induced
seismicity as the energy source driving the events is chemical rather than tectonic in nature.


There is no doubt that much of the seismic activity around the South Deep site exhibits strong correlations
with the Witwatersrand Basin, strongly influenced by the historical and ongoing mining activity in the
region. A comprehensive assessment of the hazard arising from the induced seismicity would require
attempting to separate out the local forced and triggered, induced seismicity from the naturally occurring
tectonic seismicity in the area and then treating those three categories of seismicity as separate logic
branches, each with their own individual source models with unique recurrence and Mmax characteristics.
However, this is well beyond the agreed upon scope for this study. The approach taken for this study has
been to adopt the published earthquake recurrence parameters for the EZ-Frisk and GEM 2023 ZAF
seismic source models and for the smoothed model developed for this study to exclude any events
suspected of being mining related with magnitudes less than M 4.0 in order to minimise the influence of
the induced seismicity in the hazard estimates.


3.7   Magnitude Scales
Earthquake magnitude is a measure of earthquake size rather than a measure of earthquake effect
(ground motion or intensity at a point). However, the measurement of magnitude does make use of an
earthquake effect. This is usually ground motion in some form (peak values or spectral levels of
displacement, velocity or acceleration, horizontal or vertical, etc.). Alternative scales use duration of
motion, radius or area of perception, moment or energy release. The ground motion measurements are
empirically scaled to correct for distance, so that the resulting values from seismographs at a range of
distances would all give similar values, without a systematic increase or decrease towards either near or
far distances.


There are numerous definitions of earthquake magnitude and these may cause confusion. Using a single
magnitude scale would be preferable but this is not always possible. The magnitudes of some historical
earthquakes may have been determined from instrumentation that is no longer in use. In some instances,
the manner of application has also changed over time.


For example, the original Richter magnitude ML is used for small earthquakes recorded within 600 km,
body wave magnitude mb is used for moderate magnitude earthquakes beyond 2000 km, and a range of
moment magnitudes Mw, Mww, Mwp, Mwc, etc. are used for moderate to large earthquakes, usually
beyond a few hundred kilometres. In addition, there are scales based on the duration of motion MD, and
radius of perceptibility MP, used mainly for determining magnitudes of historical earthquakes.



                                                      20



            250610 South Deep Seismicity Study.docx                          Publish Date: 10/06/2025
All scales were defined to conform as closely to the Richter magnitude as possible, but since each uses a
different measurement, the relationship is non-linear and conversion plots or calculations are needed.
Ideally the magnitude should be converted to a defined value. Modern conventions include the GSHAP
method where magnitude M is based on ML, mb and Mw, giving a scale that retains all past values.


Moment Magnitude (Mw) is based on the actual physical characteristic of the fault source which means
that it does not saturate at higher magnitudes. The Ground Motion Models (see Section 5) are defined
using Moment Magnitude.


The earthquake models in this study all use moment magnitude Mw to calculate activity rates.


The earthquake catalogue compiled for the GEM ZAF model, and the magnitude conversions applied, can
be found in Midzi et al. (2020). The earthquake catalogue compiled specifically for this study, converted
the events to Mw using the NSHA23 preferred Quadratic Simulated coefficients as outlined in Allen et al.
(2023). The earthquake catalogue compiled for the EZF Africa model, and the magnitude conversions
applied, were developed by geoForecaster, Inc, for William Lettis & Associates, Inc (WLA) (2008). They
used the computer code CLUSTER2000 (Reasonberg, 1985) to remove aftershocks and established
magnitude relationships.

4      Earthquake Recurrence Model

4.1    Recurrence of Large Earthquakes
For many locations in stable continental regions the duration of seismograph coverage and the duration
of the historical earthquake records (in the order of 100’s of years) are both much less than the return
period for large earthquakes.


The time period can be artificially increased by assuming the seismicity is uniform over a larger area and
using the ergodic principle where area is traded for time (Johnston & Kanter, 1990). For example, the
activity in an area of 1000 x 1000 km = 1,000,000 km2 accumulated for 100 years is assumed to represent
what is expected in an area of 100 x 100 km = 10,000 km2 over a period of 10,000 years.


It is assumed that the linear relationship between magnitude and the logarithm of numbers of earthquakes
(the b-value) remains constant. In this manner the rate of the smaller magnitude earthquakes is used to
predict the rate of larger magnitude earthquakes.


4.2    Geology & Neotectonics

4.2.1 Regional Geology and Tectonic Setting

The regional geology and tectonic setting of the South Deep Gold Mine site and its surrounds have been
described in detail previously, for example by Keyser (1986), Bird et al. (2006), Bumby et al. (2012),
Gaina et al. (2013), Boettcher et al. (2015), Tucker et al. (2016), Manzuzu et al. (2019) and references
therein. Using the aforementioned citations, we briefly summarise the regional geology and tectonic
setting below.


The basement geology at the South Deep Gold Mine site consists of the Archaean Kapvaal Craton – a
granite and greenstone unit overlain by metamorphosed sediments and volcanics. The site is located at
the northern margin of the late Archaean to Paleoproterozoic Witwatersrand Basin, a >300 km-long
northeast trending formation of mainly terrigenous-origin sedimentary deposits as well as basalts. In the
region of South Deep Mine, at the site of the original dams, the Witwatersrand Basin deposits are overlain
by dolomite; at the new facility at Doornport they are overlain by shale, quartzite, limestone and hornfels.


The establishment of the present-day tectonic crustal stress regime across South Africa is uncertain, but
may have been in place since ~40-11 Myrs ago. In the region of the South Deep Gold Mine site, the stress
regime is dominated by normal faulting oriented in a noutheast-southwest direction. In addition, local
mining has contributed to crustal stress changes resulting in seismicity - indeed, it has been suggested
that mining is the main source of present-day seismic activity in the broader central South Africa region
(e.g., Gibowicz et al, 1995; Mendecki, 1997; Yabe et al., 2009; Manzunzu et al., 2019) – resulting in the
reactivation of ancient faults.


4.2.2 Faulting and Neotectonics

Crucial to assessing the earthquake hazard of a site is whether that site is located nearby to a fault which
is ‘active’ or is otherwise potentially capable of generating an earthquake. The ICOLD (2016) and ANCOLD

                                                       22



             250610 South Deep Seismicity Study.docx                         Publish Date: 10/06/2025
(2019) Guidelines define an active fault as one that is known to have produced historical earthquakes or
shown evidence of movement in the last 35,000 years. Due to the long return periods (1,000’s to
100,000’s yrs) between ground-rupturing events in less seismically-active regions, older ‘neotectonic’
faults are also considered capable of generating earthquakes; these structures exhibit evidence of
displacement under the current crustal stress regime (e.g., Machette, 2000; Sandiford et al., 2004; Clark
et al., 2011; ANCOLD, 2019), which for South Africa was established sometime in the last ~40-11 Myr
(e.g., Bird et al., 2006; Gaina et al., 2013). Both active and neotectonic faults are characterised in terms
of fault attitude (strike and dip), rupture dimensions (length, width, area) and mechanism (i.e., the type
of movement on the fault – reverse/ thrust, normal/ extension or strike-slip) and are assigned a slip rate
ideally quantified using geological evidence. Some of the more active faults in South Africa have slip rates
in the order of 200 m/Myr, for instance on the Kango Fault (e.g., Bommer et al., 2015).


In addition to including faults which show evidence of activity in neotectonic times, the SRC’s seismic
hazard assessments also consider as potential sources of seismic activity regional-scale (>15-25 km in
length) ‘bedrock’ faults that are aligned favourably with the current stress regime but otherwise do not
show evidence of neotectonic movement (Ninis et al., 2018). We take this more conservative approach,
originally suggested by Crone et al. (1997), because there are many global examples where large
earthquakes have occurred on faults that do not show evidence of prior neotectonic displacement (e.g.,
Crone et al., 1997; Clark & McCue, 2003). Note that we only include regional-scale faults because rupture
of these faults would more likely produce ground motion strong enough to be damaging; we consider
faults aligned favourably with the current crustal stress regime as these structures are more likely to
undergo slip (e.g., Machette, 2000).


As part of this seismic hazard investigation, we examine all faults within 70 km of the South Deep Gold
Mine site; we consider that the seismic activity of a fault beyond 70 km from the site is adequately
represented by including its seismicity in the area source zone (e.g., Somerville et al., 2017) (see Section
4.7 Fault Sources for further details). In our hazard calculations, we also consider i) all active and
neotectonic faults within 70 km and ii) select bedrock faults within 40 km. Neotectonic and bedrock faults
are sourced from all published and unpublished reports available to us, as identified in the literature
review component of this study. We apply previously determined slip rates to these faults, or, if not
quantified, we estimate a slip rate based on all other available data. Bedrock faults, i.e., faults which do
not show evidence of movement in the last 10 Myrs, which are included in our calculations are those
which are >25 km in length and which are favourably oriented for rupture in the current crustal stress
regime, which in this region of South Africa is largely normal faulting oriented in a northeast-southwest
direction (e.g., Bird et al., 2006; Gaina et al., 2013). In this instance, we assign a low uplift rate of 1
m/Myr to these structures.


Numerous faults have previously been identified in the area of the South Deep Gold Mine site (e.g.,
Keyser, 1986; McGarr, et al., 2009). While some of these were delineated during regional geological
surface mapping, additional faults, including many that do not outcrop at the surface, were recognised
during detailed sub-surface mapping of local mines (Figure 6). No bedrock faults were included as
separate seismic sources in this study. However, two fault structures - the Pretorius Fault and the
Reitfontein Fault - reportedly show evidence of present-day seismic activity, and are therefore considered


                                                      23



            250610 South Deep Seismicity Study.docx                          Publish Date: 10/06/2025
active; these are included as separate seismic sources in our hazard calculations. We describe these faults
in more detail below.


The Pretorius Fault Zone is an east-northeast trending structure, located to the west of the South Deep
Gold Mine. The fault has been mapped as a subvertical to steeply north-northwest dipping structure,
between 1 km and >5 km beneath the surface, over a total length of 10 km. The fault last accommodated
displacement between ~2.7 and ~2.0 Ga ago, but was recently reactivated, most likely as a result of

local crustal stress changes due to mining; exposures within mine tunnels showed that segments of the

Pretorius Fault ruptured during the 2004 M2.2 TauTona Mine earthquake. At its closest point, this fault is
18 km from the South Deep Gold Mine site. As no slip rate estimate for the Pretorius Fault has been
published, we assign this as an active fault with a slip rate of 1 m/Myr.


The Reitfontein Fault (sometimes shown as the Witpoorjie Fault) is an approximately east-west oriented
structure, located to the north of the South Deep Gold Mine. The fault spans 64 km, and dips to the north.
The fault is at least ~2.0 Ga old, and has accommodated both normal and oblique reverse movement in
the geological past. Although there is no known geological or geomorphological evidence to suggest
neotectonic activity on this structure, it has previously been associated with minor present-day seismic
activity (Singh et al., 2009 and references therein). No slip rate has been published for this reportedly
active fault, so we assign a slip rate of 1 m/Myr.


Due to the predominately extensional crustal stress regime in the region surrounding the South Deep
Gold Mine site (e.g., Bird et al., 2006; Gaina et al., 2013), it is expected that the aforementioned faults
would have a predominantly normal mechanism. For additional parameters assigned to these faults as
part of the seismic hazard calculations for this dam site, please see Section 7.5 Fault Sources for South
Deep Gold Mine and Table 7. A field investigation would be required to improve our current understanding
of other faults nearby to the South Deep Gold Mine site, and to reduce the uncertainties associated with
the activity rates of the active structures included in this study.


4.2.1   Faults in the Dam Foundation

The 2019 ANCOLD Guidelines for Design of Dams for Earthquake nominate that one of the requirements
for a seismic hazard assessment is to provide information on “any known active or neotectonic faults that
have the capability to cause displacement in the foundations of the dam and appurtenant structures or
the reservoir rim…”. This section of the report addresses that requirement and looks at faults that may
influence the seismic hazard arising from both strong ground motion and fault displacement at the surface.


A close inspection of almost any pre-Cenozoic rock outcrop is likely to identify numerous small fault
displacements, and this may well be the case at the South Deep Gold Mine site. However, in terms of
fault structures capable of hosting an earthquake of sufficient magnitude to contribute to the seismic
hazard at the site, our review of all available fault data for the South Deep Gold Mine site, as outlined
above, has discovered no evidence of currently active or neotectonic faults passing through the site.

4.3       Site Conditions and Non-Linear Response
Seismic waves arriving from an earthquake are modified by the local site conditions due to a range of
effects including:


          Impedance

          Attenuation

          Resonance

          Reflection and Wave Conversion


These effects and the manner in which they are treated in Ground Motion Models are described in more
detail in Appendix G.


A simple way that modern ground motion models can consider part of these effects is to use the shear
wave velocity in metres per second to a depth of 30 metres (Vs30) as a proxy for the large-scale site
response. Note however this does not consider frequency dependent resonance, one of the main
phenomena affecting sites with soil overlying bedrock, unconsolidated sediments, and weathered or
fractured rock.


Another simple method that can be used when the near surface geology is horizontally stratified is to
determine an estimated ground motion at a bedrock level, then use a computer program such as SHAKE
to determine the variation of motion towards the surface.


If a site has complex near-surface geology, then a very complex and expensive two- or three-dimensional
computer model of the site and structure could be developed.


Alternatively, local seismograph measurements comparing motion at the site with that on nearby bedrock
should provide an indication of the expected site response to shaking as a result of a strong earthquake.
This could involve recording distant earthquakes, or simply ambient vibrations.


In this study, the Next Generation Attenuation ground motion models apply Vs30 to consider site response
in a general sense, based on the way in which many other sites with similar Vs30 values have responded.
The NGA ground motion models are based on a dataset of motions recorded at sites generally ranging
between a Vs30 of 150 m/s to 1500 m/s and it is not recommended to extrapolate beyond that range.


A Vs30 value of 600 m/s has been used for the computation of the ground motion values, as provided by
SLR Consulting (D. Roos, pers comm., 2024). If there are significant soil deposits beneath the structure,
consideration should be given to using reference bedrock results or the results presented here as input
to a non-linear soil response analysis using SHAKE, QUAD4M or similar programs to compute final ground
motion beneath the structure.


The estimated depth where velocity first exceeds 1,000 m/s (Z1.0) is 0.1 km and has been taken from
equation 17 in Abrahamson & Silva (2008). The calculated depth the velocity first exceeds 2,500 m/s
(Z2.5) has been calculated as 0.35 km from equation 6.8 in Campbell & Bozorgnia (2014).

4.4    Resonant Period
A disaggregation plot shows the contribution to hazard from earthquakes at varying distances and
magnitudes for a particular return period at a selected natural frequency/period. The period of ground
motion is typically chosen to match the resonant period of the structure being investigated as that will be
the one for which the structure is most vulnerable. The resonant period can be used in developing time
histories.


The resonant period of ground motion of engineering significance (T0) has been provided for Doornport
(New Facility) as 0.48 s (2.1 Hz). Conditional Mean Spectra and disaggregation plots have been included
for the 5,000 and 10,000 year return periods for T = 0.12 s (8.3 Hz), 0.48 s (2.1 Hz) and 1.2 s (0.83
Hz). A range of periods were used to cover both higher mode responses and period lengthening effects
due to deterioration of the structure during an earthquake.


4.5    Earthquake Recurrence Models used in this study
In contrast to models of interplate seismicity, there is no generally agreed physical model for intraplate
seismicity. To account for this uncertainty in the intraplate earthquake process, a range of possible
seismicity models is used in hazard analysis. It is assumed that this range includes the “real” model for
the seismicity.


Weights are assigned to the various possible models in order to calculate a mean hazard and fractile
levels. The assignment of weights to each model can be performed with varying degrees of complexity –
from simple weights assigned by an individual, to weights assigned via an expert elicitation process (e.g.
Aspinall, 2010; Griffin et al., 2018).


The level of seismicity (and hence hazard) predicted by each model will depend upon the assumptions
made in creating the model.


Calculations of ground motion for this study were carried out using three different earthquake recurrence
models in an attempt to capture the epistemic uncertainty inherent in PSHA. For this study we have used
three source models; EZ-Frisk’s Africa Model (WLA, 2008), the Global Earthquake Model’s (GEM) South
Africa (ZAF) model (Midzi et al., 2020) and a smoothed seismicity model developed specifically for this
study. These are described in detail in the respective references.


The varying levels of hazard between all the models are due to the methods and assumptions used to: 1)
correct for varying degrees of catalogue completeness and 2) fit recurrence curves to the dataset. This
variation is to be expected and simply indicates the degree of uncertainty in the models. There may be
other models of South Africa seismicity available. Individual models can give significantly different
outcomes and the model that gives the highest and lowest hazard depends on the site location (ANCOLD,
2019). While a completely rigorous hazard analysis would utilise all available models, this approach is
prohibitive from a time perspective. Distributed seismicity is currently represented by three groups of
source models and it is not sufficient to use only one source model due to the epistemic uncertainty in
the models (ANCOLD, 2019).

For this study we have used three source models from two different classes of models, Option (b) from
Section 2.5 1 in the 2019 ANCOLD guidelines. We believe the selected models cover the range of expected
hazard estimates.


4.6   Earthquake Magnitude Recurrence

Activity rates for area source zones are based on the Gutenberg-Richter seismicity recurrence equation.
This states that:


            log10(n) = a0 – b*M

where:      b       = Richter ‘b’-value – the relative proportion of small to large events
            M       = Earthquake magnitude
            n       = Number of earthquakes in magnitude range M±ΔM


Above a given maximum magnitude, Mmax the rate is assumed to be zero.


In practice it is easier to deal with the cumulative number of earthquakes above a given magnitude
rather than the interval number. The relation then becomes:

                                                      -bM      -bMmax
            log10(N) = log10(A0) - log10[10                 - 10        ]-

where:      N       = Number of earthquakes of magnitude M or greater.
            A0      = Number of earthquakes of magnitude zero or greater.


Earthquake numbers are normalised to rates per year per unit area, typically 100 x 100 kilometres. This
allows comparison of activity rates in different source zones.


The seismicity parameters A0 and b are determined using available earthquake data. Because of the low
probability of very large earthquakes, Mmax does not critically affect ground motion recurrence estimates
for return periods up to hundreds of years, especially when the b-value is high.


4.7   Fault Sources

If an area source zone contains a fault, then its treatment in the hazard computation depends on its
proximity to the site. For distant sites, all earthquakes are distributed uniformly across the area source
zone, and the fault is not modelled as a separate entity to the zone. In contrast, if the zone is close to
the site (within 70 km) AND the fault activity is well understood, the earthquakes associated with the
fault are included on a separate fault source and are therefore separately considered to that of the area
source zone.


Seismicity on faults is assumed to match a standard Gutenberg-Richter (exponential) distribution between
the truncated Mmin and Mmax values assigned to the fault as described below. Seismicity rates are
determined from the nominated uplift rates using standard relations from Wells and Coppersmith (1994).




                                                                   29

4.8   Maximum Considered Magnitude
The maximum credible earthquake magnitude (Mmax) is not constrained by the seismicity data but has
been estimated from the tectonic setting by each of the earthquake recurrence models authors. See
Section 7 for the values applied in this study.


Disaggregation of the hazard generally shows that the majority of hazard (at least for moderate return
periods) comes from lower magnitudes and is not unduly affected by the choice of Mmax. Identified active,
neotectonic and bedrock faults are assigned a Mmax depending on the length of surface expression
according to the relationship published in Wells and Coppersmith (1994).


The lower limit magnitude applied to a modelled fault is determined by subtracting a value from the
maximum magnitude. The amount that is subtracted depends on the maximum magnitude. See Table 2
for a summary.


                                   Table 2: Determination of Mmin from Mmax for fault sources



                                Mmax range                   Mmax – x               Mmin range

                                  6.5 to 7.4               = Mmax – 1.5              5.0 to 5.9

                                  5.8 to 6.4               = Mmax – 1.0              4.8 to 5.4

5          Ground Motion Models

5.1        Introduction
The ground motion resulting from an earthquake reduces in amplitude with distance from the earthquake
for three reasons - geometric spreading, scattering at interfaces within the earth, and absorption of
energy within the rock. A ground motion model combines the effect of these, giving a distribution of
ground motion estimates for an earthquake of magnitude M at a distance R.


5.2        Ground Motion Variability with Magnitude and Distance
Ground motion may be quantified by a simple scalar measure, such as peak ground displacement (PGD),
peak ground velocity (PGV), peak ground acceleration (PGA), or Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI). A
typical ground motion model gives ground motion, Y, in the form:


                 ln(Y) = c1 + c2M + c3MC4 + c5ln[R + c6 exp(c7M)] + c8R + f(source) + f(site)

    Y                             Ground motion parameter – Displacement, velocity or acceleration.
                                  Expressing the ground motion as a logarithm simplifies the form of the
                                  equation.
                                  Some parameters, such as intensity, are already logarithmic.
    M                             Earthquake magnitude.
    R                             Distance between earthquake and site. There are numerous ways this can be
                                  defined.
    c1,2,3,4                      Earthquake magnitude is related to the logarithm of some ground motion
                                  parameter. Consequently, ln(Y) should be approximately proportional to M.

    c5                            Geometrical spreading causes body wave amplitudes to decrease at a rate of
                                  1/R and surface wave amplitudes to decrease by 1/√𝑅

    c6,7                          Larger magnitude earthquakes will rupture a larger area. As a result, waves
                                  that arrive from the earthquake will come from a range of distances. The
                                  distance term must be modified to take this into account.
    c8                            Absorption causes ground motion amplitudes to decrease exponentially with
                                  R.
    Source Effects                Source characteristics (e.g. focal mechanism, depth) will affect ground
                                  motion.
    Site Effects                  The low velocity layers at the site will affect ground motion.



5.3        Ground Motion Variability with Frequency

For a spectral ground motion model giving Fourier spectra or response spectra, we need to compute the
ground motion estimate, Y, over a range of frequencies, giving Y(f). A range of frequencies must be
chosen, with f ranging from about 0.1 Hz (a period of 10 seconds) up to about 100 Hz, and usually
distributed logarithmically (e.g. 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0, 50.0, 100.0). Most of the
parameters (c1 to c8) vary with frequency, requiring c1(f) to c8(f), to be defined for each frequency.


The spectral ground motion is a function of frequency, so a set of Y(f) values are determined.




                                                           31



               250610 South Deep Seismicity Study.docx                              Publish Date: 10/06/2025
The spectral acceleration at high frequencies, (e.g. 100 Hz, or T = 0.01 s), is numerically very close to
the peak ground acceleration.


5.4   Aleatory Variability
In practice, the observed ground motion values in any particular region, for any given M and R, vary due
to a variety of issues relating to the earthquake source, the seismic wave travel path, and the seismograph
site. Rather than an equation giving a particular value of ground motion, modern ground motion models
now give a probability distribution, usually assuming a log-normal distribution and providing a mean and
standard distribution.


The logarithmic distribution implies that estimates above the mean will increase the hazard more than
those below the mean will reduce the hazard, so their inclusion will increase the overall hazard estimate.


The software used in this study (EZ-FRISK by Fugro USA Land, Inc.) calculates hazard with a four σ limit
on the extent of aleatory variability.


5.5   Source Effects

Most current ground motion models do not consider the radiation pattern generated by a fault rupture,
and actual fault ruptures are much more complex than a simple constant slip over a rectangular area that
is usually assumed. Other source parameters, such as stress change, will alter both the amplitude and
spectral shape of the ground motion.


5.6   Site Effects

Soft sediments amplify the low frequency seismic waves of large earthquakes but will reduce the ground
motion of smaller local events by the absorption of high frequency seismic waves. If surface sediments
are located at the site, the ground motion at the natural frequency and other higher modes will be
amplified by resonance. This can be particularly important if the natural frequency of a site corresponds
with that of a local structure, as the site and structure resonance amplifications will combine and multiply.
The bedrock spectrum estimated for the site must be multiplied by a frequency-dependent transfer
function that depends on the depth and velocities of sediments.


Non-linear response of sediments, deep residual soils and completely weathered rock overlying the
bedrock foundation have not been considered in the results presented in this report. If sediments expected
to generate non-linear effects are present between the structure foundation and engineering bedrock,
then the results of this report should be used as input to model those effects.


See Appendix G for discussion on site effects and definitions of the terms used.


5.7   Epistemic Uncertainties

Probabilistic hazard studies use both Earthquake Recurrence Models and Ground Motion Models applicable
for the region surrounding the site being considered. Earthquake recurrence models may suffer from lack
of data or uncertain magnitudes and are often poorly defined. Ground motion models are often taken
from other regions with similar tectonics and geology rather than from local data but may still not be

                                                       32



             250610 South Deep Seismicity Study.docx                          Publish Date: 10/06/2025
applicable for the particular region. The models used may give consistently high or low hazard estimates,
or they may give invalid results for low or high frequencies, small or large earthquakes, and near or
distant epicentres.


Variations between the results from alternative models may easily be compared by superimposing plots.
It may be difficult to decide which models are likely to be most appropriate for the site, but the variations
on such plots may give a suggestion of likely systematic error. Once all credible models have been
determined, a weighted mean may provide the best estimate for the hazard.


To prevent excessive weighting to models that give high hazard results, if the hazard value is log-normally
distributed (displacement, velocity or acceleration, or spectral values of these) then a weighted geometric
mean may be more appropriate than a weighted arithmetic mean.


5.8    History of Attenuation Functions
Early attenuation functions simply gave a ground motion value estimated from earthquake magnitude
and distance. Modern versions include other factors and describe a distribution of possible ground motion
values to incorporate uncertainty. Modern functions are usually referred to as Ground Motion Models
(GMMs) or sometimes Ground Motion Prediction Equations (GMPEs).


Many Ground Motion Models have been published for different geological and tectonic settings. At one
extreme are stable cratonic shields (e.g. Eastern Canada, Central and Western Australia, Southern China)
where cold, hard and/or old rocks transmit seismic waves without absorbing significant energy. At the
other extreme are active plate boundary regions, especially subduction regions, where hot, soft and/or
young rocks absorb considerable seismic wave energy. Many regions (eastern Australia and California)
display ground motion variations in between these limits.


There is a major lack of ground motion attenuation data in the study area. Until a range of local Ground
Motion Models can be derived, functions from areas with a similar geology must be used.


In 2006 the Atkinson-Boore (2006) ground motion model was derived for Eastern North America (ENA).
This is a stable continental regional model and can be used in Ghana where the seismicity and tectonic
regime might be considered stable.


A new series of Ground Motion Models, the Next Generation Attenuation (NGA) models, were published
in 2008. These were derived using more and better strong motion data and performed better than older
functions at extremes of magnitude, distance and frequency.


The Pezeshk et al. ground motion model was developed in 2011 and has a function for both Eastern North
America for Vs30 values of ≥ 2000 m/s and Western North America (WNA) using a Vs30 value of 620
m/s.


In 2014, the NGA models were replaced with the NGA-West2 models. These are an extension of the work
done in 2008 brought about by the availability of an additional 19,000 three-component recordings over
increased magnitude and distance ranges. The functions were calculated for a series of different damping

      factors (0.5 – 30%, as opposed to just 5% damping) and an extension to the long periods from 10 seconds
      to 20 seconds. These models include; Abrahamson et al. (2014) NGA-West2, Boore et al. (2014) NGA-
      West2, Campbell-Bozorgnia (2014) NGA-West2, Chiou-Youngs (2014) NGA-West2 and Idriss (2014) NGA-
      West2.


      In 2018 the Goulet et al. ground motion model was released and is an NGA model for Central and Eastern
      North America (CENA).


      For this study we followed the approach of GEM (Midzi et al., 2020) and used a selection of both active
      shallow crustal and stable continental region ground motion models and weighted them equally.


      5.9     Selection of Ground Motion Models
      The ground motion models applied in this study (for spectral response), along with their range of
      applicability, are listed in Table 3.

6     Probabilistic Hazard Assessment

6.1   Outline
Cornell’s (1968) probabilistic seismic hazard assessment (PSHA) takes into account the ground motion
from a minimum considered earthquake magnitude up to the maximum credible earthquake that can
occur in each source zone or along each fault that can affect a site. It is calculated from the rate of
occurrence of these earthquakes, their distance from the site, and the attenuation of ground motion
between the earthquake and the site.


The PSHA numerically integrates ground motion probabilities to produce the annual frequency of
exceedance of each different ground motion variable of interest.


Parameters of ground motion with a single value (i.e. PGA, PGV and MMI) are plotted versus the Annual
Frequency of Exceedance (or Return Period) to produce a hazard curve.


For the response spectrum, the results are plotted for discrete return periods as nominated by the client.
These are termed Uniform Hazard Response Spectra because there is the same level of hazard (same
probability of exceedance) at every point on the curve.


6.2   Disaggregation

The Uniform Hazard Response Spectrum is not the response spectra from any one earthquake but is the
cumulative result of many possible earthquakes – at varying magnitudes and distances from the site
being studied.


A Disaggregation plot can be produced for a nominated period that shows the contribution of the various
combinations of magnitude and distance to the total hazard. This plot will change depending upon the
frequency chosen. The peaks of this plot are used to select appropriate candidate earthquakes (based on
magnitude and distance) to generate time histories from a database of actual recorded earthquake ground
motions. The ground motion of the selected earthquake can then be scaled or matched to provide an
input motion for active modelling of the structure. Disaggregation results are also used as an input when
generating vertical response spectra results.


6.3   Conditional Mean Spectrum

The ground motion of most interest from an engineering perspective is that at the resonant frequency of
the structure under consideration. This is the motion most likely to cause resonance of, and thus damage
to, the structure.


The Uniform Hazard Response Spectrum (UHRS) can be mathematically modified to provide a Conditional
Mean Spectrum (CMS) that is closer to the theoretical spectrum that a single earthquake could produce
with the nominated probability (Baker, 2015). It matches the UHRS at the nominated frequency but is
normally lower at all surrounding frequencies.




                                                       35



             250610 South Deep Seismicity Study.docx                        Publish Date: 10/06/2025
The CMS is often the motion used as the target spectrum when selecting and scaling real earthquake
ground motion records. The ground motion recorded from a suitable candidate earthquake (selected using
the magnitude-distance criteria of the disaggregation plot) is modified to match the CMS target spectrum
either by direct spectral scaling or by a matching process.


6.4   Minimum Considered Magnitude

The motion due to small nearby earthquakes has content dominated by high frequencies, with minimal
low frequency motion. This leads to high accelerations, but low ground displacements, and little chance
of damage to major structures. Small earthquakes also have very short duration. For events smaller than
magnitude 5, the strong motion typically lasts only a fraction of a second, so they cannot cause resonance
in a major structure whose natural period may be 1 second or more. Resonance requires a number of
cycles of earthquake motion at the natural frequency of the structure.


Including smaller magnitude earthquakes in a hazard analysis will unnecessarily increase the acceleration
estimates (at high frequencies – short periods). By restricting the minimum magnitude considered in the
hazard estimation, the high frequency, high acceleration, low displacement, and short duration motion
from small earthquakes is eliminated.


The choice of the minimum magnitude is an engineering decision that depends on the type of structure
being considered, with larger structures being less affected by small earthquakes than small structures.
Minimum magnitude values typically range from 4 up to 6.


Note that some ground motion equations have been developed for a minimum magnitude of 5.0 and use
of a lower minimum magnitude may not be appropriate.


For the structure under consideration in this report, a minimum magnitude of 5.0 is considered
appropriate, and unless otherwise noted this value is used for the calculations in this report. These results
should therefore not be used for analysis of appurtenant structures or elements that may be affected by
short duration, high frequency motions.


6.5   Maximum Considered Distance
In most locations, earthquakes with hypocentral distances greater than about 300 kilometres can usually
be ignored in ground motion calculations, as the effect of these earthquakes on stronger ground motion
estimates is negligible. Large earthquakes at greater distances may be felt, though not at levels that will
produce damage. For this study, for all five earthquake recurrence models used, we have included all
zones or grid cells that are within a maximum distance of 300 kilometres from the site. Note that because
the entire zone is included in the regional and background models, and some of the zones are very large,
there is some contribution from earthquakes beyond 300 km.

7      Inputs used in Analysis
All results in this report were calculated using the EZ-FRISK software package supplied by Fugro USA
Land, Inc.


7.1    Parameters
Unless otherwise stated the minimum magnitude used in calculations was Mw 5.0 and the Vs30 was
600 m/s for the Doornport (New Facility) site. The earthquake recurrence models were all equally
weighted in the hazard computation process.


Ground Motion Models used in the analyses were previously described in Section 5 and are detailed in
Table 4. Note that the aleatory variability inherent in the Ground Motion Models is truncated at four σ in
the computation of the hazard values.

7.4    Smoothed Seismicity Models for South Deep Gold Mine
The smoothed seismicity model has been developed specifically for this study by SRC staff member Russell
Cuthbertson using the earthquake catalogue described in Section 3.4. The smoothed seismicity model is
based solely on the historical earthquake database with no input from tectonics or geology. The change
in the level of earthquake detection over time must be taken into account to produce a uniform database
for analysis.


Seismicity was summed over a radial distance of 50km on a 0.2 degree (~20km) grid. Seismicity rates
were adjusted for the level of earthquake detection over time using a detection curve obtained from the
recorded regional seismicity.


Seismicity rates were calculated by assuming two different b-values: b=1.0 for regional areas and b=1.3
for the gold mining areas and fitting the rates using a least-squares fit. These b-values were obtained by
averaging those in Midzi et al. (2020).


Figure 11 show the seismicity rates (number of events per cell per year multiplied by 10,000 for a
minimum magnitude of 5) for the South Deep smoothed seismicity model, from low hazard (blue) to
higher hazard (purple).

            7.5     Fault Sources for South Deep Gold Mine
            All known active or neotectonic fault sources within a maximum horizontal distance of 70 km of the site,
            and select bedrock fault sources within a maximum horizontal distance of 40 km of the site, in combination
            with the earthquake recurrence models used, have been included in all subsequent analyses (see Section
            4.2 for further details on these faults). The parameters for these fault sources are listed Table 7.


            The distance quoted in the table is the closest distance to the fault plane. This is not necessarily the
            distance term used in the computations of the hazard, which may use a range of distance measures
            depending on the ground motion model. The fault sources modelled in the study area are mapped in
            Figure 7 (Section 4.2).


            Due to the episodicity of earthquake recurrence on faults in some stable continental regions, whereby
            through time faults show evidence of periods of heightened activity alternating with periods of quiescence
            (e.g. Stirling et al., 2011), there is a large amount of uncertainty associated with fault uplift rates. To
            allow for this, we follow the approach of Stirling et al. (2011) whereby factors of 0.1, 1 and 10 have been
            applied to the uplift rate of a given fault, to estimate uplift during a quiescent phase (x 0.1 the average
            uplift rate), the average uplift rate (x 1), and uplift during an active phase (x 10 of uplift rate),
            respectively. To represent the probability of the fault being in each of these phases, these rates are then
            weighted by 0.18 for the quiescent phase, 0.8 for the average uplift rate and 0.02 for the active phase
            (Figure 12).


            Slip rates are determined from the uplift rate and dip values as provided in Table 7.

8     Sensitivity Analysis
This section of the report analyses and compares the contribution to the overall estimated seismic hazard
at the site arising from the individual seismic sources, the selected ground motion models and the different
earthquake recurrence models used as well as the Vs30 applied. A site sensitivity analysis was also
conducted to understand the hazard at the site of the four old dams compared to the new facility.


8.1   Site Sensitivity
A Peak Ground Acceleration and a Uniform Hazard Response Spectra for a 475 year and 10,000 year
return period sensitivity analyses have been completed for the South Deep Gold Mine sites; the four old
dams and the new facility. A comparison of the sites, for a Vs30 value of 600 m/s and for a minimum
magnitude of Mw 5, is presented in Figure 13 and Figure 14 as well as in Table 10 and Table 11 (Appendix
A).

The sensitivity plots indicate there is a little difference in hazard between the sites and that a single set
of results is sufficient for this study. Unless otherwise stated, the Doornport (New Facility) site has been
used for the remaining calculations in this study.

8.3   Hazard related to Ground Motion Models
The Uniform Hazard Response Spectra for a 10,000 year return period has been computed using each of
the different GMMs used with a weighting of one in order to demonstrate the relative contributions from
the individual Ground Motion Models in Figure 16. The hazard curves are all in relative agreement apart
from the Goulet et al. (2018) NGA East ground motion model which is higher at almost all periods, as is
expected for ground motion models developed for low attenuation regions.
8.4   Hazard related to Earthquake Recurrence Models
The Uniform Hazard Response Spectra for a 10,000 year return period has been disaggregated into the
contributions from the individual earthquake recurrence models in Figure 17.

Each model uses a different approach to characterise seismicity rates. The smoothed model only considers
historical seismicity while the EZF and GEM models use a more detailed analysis of seismicity combined
with geological information.

8.5   Earthquake Recurrence Model weightings
The three earthquake recurrence models have been equally weighted in this study. Figure 18 compares
the relative levels of seismic hazard in terms of PGA provided from each of the three individual earthquake
recurrence models in addition to the hazard arising from the fault sources. Table 8 compares the mean
PGA recurrence results in g for each of the individual earthquake recurrence models (without faults) with
the equal weighted mean of the three earthquake recurrence models, for the requested return periods,
using a minimum magnitude of Mw 5 and a Vs30 value of 600 m/s for the Doornport (New Facility) site.
Fault sources are not included in the individual earthquake recurrence models to compare the various
models independently; however, they are applied to each of the models for the equal weighted mean.

Detailed tabulated return periods for PGA values are also listed in Table 12 (Appendix A).

8.6   Vs30 Sensitivity
A Peak Ground Acceleration and a Uniform Hazard Response Spectra for a 475 year and 10,000 year
return period sensitivity analyses have been completed for alternate Vs30 values for the Doornport (New
Facility) site. A comparison of alternate values of 600 m/s and 800 m/s, for a minimum magnitude of
Mw 5, is presented in Figure 19 and Figure 20 as well as in Table 13 and Table 14 (Appendix A).

9     Doornport (New Facility) Hazard Results

9.1   Peak Ground Acceleration Hazard
The Peak Ground Acceleration hazard curve for a minimum magnitude of Mw 5.0 and a Vs30 value of
600 m/s is presented in Figure 21 for the Doornport (New Facility) site.

For a return period of 475 years (10% in 50 years), the weighted mean PGA is approximately 0.33 g and
for 10,000 years it is 1.3 g.

9.2     Uniform Hazard Response Spectra - Horizontal Motion
Uniform Hazard Response Spectra (5% damping) have been computed for the horizontal motion for
magnitudes of 5 and above and return periods of 250, 475, 1,000, 2,000, 5,000 and 10,000 for a Vs30
value of 600 m/s.

These results are presented in Figure 22 to Figure 24, as well as in Table 15 (Appendix A). Figure 22 plots
period (in seconds) versus response acceleration (in mm/s2) on a linear-linear plot. Figure 23 plots period
(in seconds) versus response acceleration (in mm/s2) on a log-linear plot.


In Figure 24 the results have been converted to pseudo-velocity (in mm/s) and plotted versus frequency
(in Hz) on a tripartite plot, with acceleration (in gravity ‘g’) and pseudo-displacement (mm) lines also
plotted.


A Pseudo Relative Velocity spectrum is computed from the acceleration response spectrum by dividing by

2f, and gives a better indication of low frequency motion, especially when plotted on a log-log tripartite

plot.


Uniform Hazard Response Spectra are not the response spectra from particular earthquakes, but are the
cumulative result of all possible earthquakes, small and large, near and far, for the particular return
period.

9.3   Deterministic/Scenario Event Analysis
The ANCOLD Guidelines (2019) in Section 2.3 nominate a preference for a risk based approach over the
deterministic approach for High and Extreme Consequence Category Dams. The guidelines further indicate
that the decision over which approach to take is for the Owner to consider in consultation with the
Regulator.


The ANCOLD Guidelines (2019) suggest that the deterministic approach may be used for Extreme
Consequence Category dams where there are “active” classified faults in the vicinity of the dam. As the
Doornport (New Facility) site will be classified as an Extreme Consequence Category site once the final
height of 65m is achieved, the deterministic results have been provided.


The results from the computed deterministic spectra are presented in Figure 25 and Figure 26, as well as
in Table 17 (Appendix A). Figure 25 plots period (in seconds) versus response acceleration (in g) on a
log-linear plot. In Figure 26 the deterministic spectra (85th percentile) has been compared to the
10,000 year probabilistic spectra. There is no return period or Annual Exceedance Probability associated
with these deterministic results, although they are sometimes conceptually described as having an infinite
return period.


The ANCOLD Guidelines (2019) specify that, for an extreme Consequence Category structure such as the
Doornport (New Facility) site, the Safety Evaluation Earthquake (SEE) may be the greater of the ground
motion from the MCE on known active faults (85th percentile) or the 10,000 year return period probabilistic
spectra (85th percentile) and that the decision of which to use is for the owner of the structure. In this
case, the ground motion from the MCE on the Pretorius Fault up to 0.1 s and then on the Reitfontein Fault
up to 10 s (85th percentile) is lower than the 10,000 year probabilistic results and the probabilistic 10,000
year 85th percentile results.

9.4       Conditional Mean Spectrum
A Uniform Hazard Response Spectrum shows levels of ground motion at various frequencies that are
expected to be exceeded with the nominated probability over a nominated time (e.g. 10% in 50 years).
The spectrum represents the envelope of ground motion possible from a large number of earthquake
scenarios - not from one particular earthquake. No one earthquake will be responsible for the exceedance
over the entire spectrum.


The Conditional Mean Spectrum (CMS) is a more rigorous, mathematically-based solution to this problem
(Baker, 2015; Somerville et al., 2015). The CMS is a spectrum that has been generated to represent a
more realistic spectrum from a single earthquake. The mathematics requires a frequency to be specified.
This frequency is normally the natural frequency of the structure being investigated as that will be the
one for which the structure is most vulnerable. However, to appropriately represent the response of the
structure across the full period range, it is necessary to develop a suite of CMS at different periods and
to match or scale time histories to each of the CMS (Somerville et al., 2015).


The original UHRS and the corresponding CMS for T = 0.12 s (8.33 Hz), 0.48 s (2.08 Hz) and 1.2 s
(0.83 Hz) is presented for return periods of 5,000 and 10,000 years for a Vs30 value of 600 m/s in Figure
27, as well as in Table 18 (Appendix A). Note that the Conditional Mean Spectra curve meets the Uniform
Hazard Response Spectra curve at the nominated frequencies (indicated by the vertical black dotted
lines).

9.5   Disaggregation
Probabilistic seismic hazard assessment estimates exceedances of ground motion with respect to an
infinite set of earthquakes of different magnitudes at all possible locations. The magnitude-distance
disaggregation plot shows how the various combinations of magnitude and distance contribute to the
hazard at specified return periods and ground motion frequencies.


Figure 29 to Figure 34 give the disaggregation plots and epsilon values for each magnitude-distance
disaggregation bin for Doornport (New Facility) estimated for T = 0.12 s (8.33 Hz), 0.48 s (2.08 Hz) and
1.2 s (0.83 Hz) and return periods of 5,000 and 10,000 years. These results were calculated using a
weighted mean of seismic source models and weighted mean of ground motion models, as described
above. These results are summarised in Table 9.




The results calculated for a 5,000 year return period for T = 0.12 s (8.33 Hz) shows that the dominant
source of ground motion would be produced by nearby events up to 25 kilometres away with moderate
sized magnitude events between Mw 5.0 and 5.5.

10 Discussion
A minimum considered magnitude of 5 was used for the majority of calculations in this study. Increasing
the magnitude cut-off will eliminate some high frequency, high acceleration, low displacement and short
duration motion from the record. It was assumed that no motion from an earthquake below magnitude 5
would have any effect on the structures under consideration. A lower minimum cut-off magnitude would
increase ground motion recurrence, especially high frequency motion and peak ground acceleration.


Site response has been partially considered within this report by applying a Vs30 value of 600 m/s to the
ground motion models used. This does not consider frequency dependent site amplification (resonance),
or other phenomena such as basin edge effects but attempts to represent seismic site response in a
general sense based on the way in which many other sites having similar Vs30 affect the characteristics
of ground motion.


EZ-FRISK’s Africa model, the Global Earthquake Model’s (GEM) Africa (ZAF) model and a smoothed
seismicity model were used in an attempt to capture the epistemic uncertainty of model selection. These
were equally weighted in the results.


As discussed in Section 2 “Previous Hazard Studies” the PGA for a 475 year return period (10% in 50
years) estimated for this study of 0.33 g is in relatively close agreement with the most recent global scale
study for the region, GEM 2023, which gives estimated PGA of 0.35 to 0.55 g for a 475 year return period.
The earlier 2019 GEM study likewise gave similar results with an estimated PGA value of 0.2 to 0.35 g.


The Midzi et al. (2020) study estimates lower hazard values at 0.1 to 0.16 g for a 475 year return period.
This is likely due to the use of two ground motion models both of which are derived for active shallow
crustal regions (ASC) which would normally produce higher attenuation and hence lower hazard than
ground motion models derived from stable continental regions (SCR). South Africa is generally considered
a SCR. Midzi makes a quite compelling argument that ASC ground motion models may be appropriate, so
we have included ground motion models derived for both ASC and SCR and included five ground motion
models in total in order to better capture the epistemic uncertainty.


Figure 16 shows that both NGA-West 2 ground motion models derived for ASC regions give lower ground
motions than the three SCR models used, with the most recent Goulet et al 2018 NGA East SCR ground
motion model contributing the highest values. The spread of ground motion estimates provided in Figure
16 is a reflection of the uncertainty surrounding attenuation rates in the area, and we believe the inclusion
of the models selected is justifiable given this uncertainty.


Unlike the above mentioned studies, this site specific study uses three different seismic source models in
order to capture the epistemic uncertainty as suggested by the ANCOLD guidelines and it is quite common
that the inclusion of uncertainty leads to increases in seismic hazard estimates. In comparison with earlier
site specific studies the differences between ground motion models selected and the inclusion of
uncertainty are likely to be the most significant causes of any difference in the estimated hazard.

The effects are those of large earthquakes. The higher frequencies of seismic waves from smaller nearby
events yield different effects, and in particular are more likely to be heard rather than felt at low intensity.

Appendix C – Glossary
Accelerograph
      A seismic recording instrument that records the acceleration of ground motion (compare with a
      seismograph).
Aftershock
      Smaller earthquakes located in the same volume within the earth as a major or moderate
      earthquake, and occurring in the following days or weeks (sometimes longer). Shallow
      mainshocks often have many aftershocks, while deep earthquakes have few. Aftershocks in
      regions that are normally inactive can last for months or years.

Attenuation
     The reduction of seismic wave amplitude with distance from an earthquake. This is due to
     geometric spreading, absorption of energy within the rock, and scattering of seismic waves.

Attenuation Function
     A function describing the attenuation of seismic waves, usually giving ground motion as a
     function of earthquake magnitude, distance and depth, and sometimes including other
     earthquake source, travel path or surface site parameters. Spectral attenuation functions also
     give the variation of ground motion with frequency.

Depth (of an earthquake)
     The distance from the earthquake hypocentre to its epicentre, usually measured in kilometres.
     Note that the hypocentre of a large earthquake that produces a surface rupture is usually a
     number of kilometres beneath the surface.

Epicentral Distance
     The distance from the earthquake epicentre around the surface of the earth to the point
     concerned.

Epicentre
     The point on the earth’s surface vertically above the hypocentre.

Frequency (of seismic waves)
     The number of cycles per second (hertz) of a seismic waveform.

Hanging Wall Effect

      The hanging wall (HW) effect is defined as the increase in ground motion at short distances for
      sites on the hanging wall side of a rupture when compared to sites on the footwall (FW) side at
      the same closest distance. In general, it is a geometrical effect due to the use of a closest
      distance metric, such as rupture distance, that does not capture the main features of the ground
      motion scaling for sites near dipping faults (Donahue & Abrahamson, 2014).
Hypocentre
     The point within the earth at which the earthquake rupture initiated.

Intensity
     A measure used to indicate the effect of ground motion at a point. A number of intensity scales
     such as the modified Mercalli and Rossi-Forel have been defined (see Appendix A).

Liquefaction
      Temporary loss of shear strength due to an increase in pore pressure during strong ground
      motion, particularly hazardous with unconsolidated saturated silty sands.
m/Myr
    Geological definition of slip rate, measured in metres (m) per million (M) years (yr).

Magnitude
     A number indicating the “size” of an earthquake. It is closely related to the amount of energy
     released during the rupture, or to the rate at which energy is released. There are a number of
     magnitude scales in use, each measured in a different way. If the word magnitude is used
     without qualification, in the past it usually referred to the Richter magnitude ML, but is now
     usually the moment magnitude Mw. The ML, Ms and Mw scales give similar numerical values.
Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE)

      Both ANCOLD and ICOLD define the MCE as the largest reasonably conceivable earthquake
      magnitude that is considered to be possible along a recognized fault or within a geographically
      defined tectonic province, under the presently known or presumed tectonic framework.

mb
      Body wave magnitude used for large distant earthquakes, especially deep earthquakes. In
      Australia, magnitude mb often does not correlate well with the other magnitude scales.

ML
      Richter local magnitude is measure of the size of the earthquakes used for smaller nearby
      earthquakes, usually within 600 km. defined by Richter in 1935 as “the logarithm of the
      calculated trace amplitude, expressed in microns with which the standard short period torsion
      seismometer … would register the shock at an epicentral distance of 100 km”. Usually can only
      be used for events up to about magnitude ML 5.5 to 6.0.

Mp
      Perceptibility magnitude, based on the radius over which an earthquake is felt. Recent
      earthquakes are used to calibrate the scale, usually to ML, so MP is numerically equivalent to ML.
      Useful for estimating magnitudes of historical earthquakes. Sometimes denoted by ML(I).
Ms
      Surface wave magnitude, used for large distant shallow earthquakes. Usually can only be used
      for events of magnitude Ms 6.0 or larger.

Mw/Mwp
    Moment magnitude, used for larger earthquakes recorded by digital seismographs. This is
    probably the most reliable magnitude code, and it is hoped that it will be applied to smaller
    earthquakes in the near future. Mwp is based on an estimate of moment calculated from the
    integral displacement of the P wave recorded on broadband instruments.

Modified Mercalli Intensity
      An intensity scale defined by Mercalli and later modified (see Appendix A).
NEHRP

National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program shear wave velocity site class category.
      (see Appendix G).

Operating Basis Earthquake (OBE)
     The OBE is that level of ground motion at the dam site for which only minor damage is
     acceptable. The dam, appurtenant structures and equipment should remain functional and
     damage from the occurrence of earthquake shaking not exceeding the OBE should be easily
     repairable.
Response Spectrum
     A spectrum indicating the peak response of a damped simple harmonic oscillator to a specified
     ground motion. The ordinate plotted may be peak acceleration, velocity or displacement
     response.

Richter (local) Magnitude, ML
      See ML above.

Rrup
       Closest distance to fault plane.
Safety Evaluation Earthquake (SEE)
       Both ANCOLD and ICOLD define the SEE as the recommended maximum level of ground motion
       for which the dam should be designed or analysed. Damage can be accepted, but there should be
       no uncontrolled release of water from the reservoir or tailings from tailings dams.

SRC
       The Seismology Research Centre, originally established at Preston Institute of Technology in
       Melbourne during 1976. PIT was renamed Phillip Institute of Technology in 1982, and was
       amalgamated into RMIT university in 1992. In 1998 the centre became a commercial group of
       Mindata Australia, and in 2002 became a division of Environmental Systems and Services Pty Ltd.

Universal Time
     To avoid confusion associated with different time zones in different states, and with daylight
     saving time, all seismologists use Universal Time. This is almost identical with Greenwich Mean
     Time. In eastern Australia, UT is ten hours behind Eastern Standard Time, or eleven hours behind
     Eastern Daylight Saving Time.

Appendix E – Statistics of Random Events
With discrete variables (e.g. coin tosses) it is possible to quote probabilities for a particular event occurring
(e.g. two heads). In the context of continuous variables (such as earthquake magnitudes) it is
meaningless to quote probabilities for an event of size X as no one event will be exactly that size. With a
continuous variable we must refer to the probability of an event that exceed a specific size (exceedance
probability).


To aid readability in the discussion below “event” will be taken to mean “event above a particular size”.


The simplest way to describe a random process is as a rate, or its inverse - the average return period (T).
For example this rate may be “two events per 100 years” which equates to an average “return period of
50 years”. In this case the Annual Frequency of Exceedance (AFE) is 2/100 = 0.02.


Note that the term “return period” or even “average return period” is discouraged in some quarters as it
is sometimes interpreted to mean that only one event will occur in the return period.


If each event is independent then the probability (P) that an event occurring in time (t) follows a Poisson
process and is given by:


         P = 1 – exp (-t/T)


Thus, there is a 0.99% probability that a structure will experience an event with a 10,000 year return
period once in 100 years.


The above formula can be rearranged to provide return period given a design life and the accepted
probability:


         T = -t / ln (1-P)


If t=1 year then the probability is termed the Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP). Most often for
engineering purposes (such as Loading Codes) the time period is 50 years.


For low probabilities AFE and AEP are approximately equal, so an event with an AEP of 1% has an AFE of
1.0005%.


For higher probabilities the approximation is not as accurate. For example, an event having a probability
of 10% of occurring in 50 years will have a return period of 475 years – Not 500 years using the
approximation.

Appendix F – Ground Motion Parameters
Earthquake ground motion can be measured as displacements, velocities, or accelerations. Low frequency
(long period) ground motion controls the ground displacement, while acceleration is controlled by the
high-frequency motion.


The peak amplitudes of these measures (peak ground displacement, peak ground velocity – PGV or peak
ground acceleration – PGA) can be used as simple measures of the ground motion for an earthquake.
However these peak measurements give no indication of the frequency or the duration of the ground
motion.


PGA has been used in engineering applications because it is easy to measure (the response of most
instruments being proportional to ground acceleration) and because it can be related to the force on a
short-period building. It is a convenient single number to enable rough evaluation of importance of
records.


For hazard purposes PGA is considered equivalent to the spectral response at 100 Hertz (0.01 seconds).


However PGA is not a measure of the force on most buildings and it is controlled by the high frequency
content in the ground motion. Accelerograms can show isolated short-duration, high-amplitude spikes
that have little engineering significance.


For example, in 1994 we recorded a PGA of 0.97 g at a distance of 1 km from an earthquake of magnitude
4.1. The dominant energy was at a frequency of tens of hertz, well above the natural frequency of even
small houses and the duration was only about one tenth of a second. The earthquake did only minor
damage, including cracked windows.


A more useful representation of the ground motion is the response spectrum, which gives the peak
response of a Single Degree Of Freedom, damped harmonic oscillator to the ground motion as a function
of frequency. The response spectrum for a particular earthquake vibration depends on the level of
damping of the hypothetical oscillator, with a value of 5% typically being used.

Appendix G – Site Factors
Seismic waves arriving from an earthquake are modified by the local site conditions due to a range of
effects including:


•      Impedance
       As seismic waves pass from hard rock to soft rock, the reduced seismic impedance (due to lower
       velocity and lower density) results in an increase in wave amplitude at all periods of motion.


•      Attenuation
       The absorption of seismic wave energy is greater for soft sediments than for hard rock. If sediment
       layers are thick, then this will affect surface motion. Short period motion is absorbed (attenuated)
       more quickly than long period motion. Thick soft sediments can significantly reduce short period
       motion, and thus PGA, resulting in period dependent attenuation.


•      Resonance
       Low velocity surface layers resonate at natural periods that depend on the thickness and velocities
       of these layers. The fundamental natural period gives maximum amplification, and higher modes
       give lower amplifications at a series of shorter periods, resulting in period-dependant amplification
       and attenuation.


•      Reflection and Wave Conversion
       A proportion of seismic wave energy will be reflected at every interface and wave motion will also
       be converted (between P-wave, S-wave and surface waves).


If the layers are not horizontal, they vary in thickness, or they have limited lateral extent, there can be
additional effects including basin resonance and focusing of seismic energy. These are generally not
included in any site hazard evaluation.


All the above effects can vary rapidly with location, with significant changes over distances of hundreds
or even tens of metres.


Some or all of the above can be considered in the treatment of site response in hazard estimates. A simple
model consisting of flat-lying layers (1D model) is sufficient to incorporate the majority of the site effects.




                                                       94

Simpler representations of the sediment column can be defined. The most commonly used are:


     •     Vs30      Time-averaged shear-wave velocity (in m/s) down to 30 metres.


     •     Z1        Depth (in m) at which the shear wave velocity reaches 1000 m/s second.


     •     Z2.5      Depth (in km) at which the shear wave velocity reaches 2500 m/s.


Vs30 primarily provides information relating to impedance amplification and attenuation while Z1 and
Z2.5 are more likely to relate to resonance effects.


The NGA Ground Motion Models use Vs30 as the primary parameter for characterizing the effects of
sediment stiffness on ground motions. The use of Vs30 in place of generic soil and rock categories has
the advantage that it is consistent with the site classification used in current building codes. This should
not imply that 30 m is the key depth range for the site response, but rather that Vs30 is correlated with
the entire soil profile.


National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP) soil classifications (which are also consistent
with site classes used by Caltrans, in the Uniform Building Code. the American Society of Civil Engineers
and the California Building Code) are shown in Table 20. The International Building Code uses the average
shear wave velocity of the upper 100 ft (Vs100) which would be essentially identical to Vs30.


Vs30 values can be measured using seismic geophysical techniques or estimated from CPT and SPT
results.
