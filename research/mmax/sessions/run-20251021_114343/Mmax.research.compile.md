# Analysis of $M_{\max} = 7.2$ for the Reitfontein Fault at South Deep Mine, South Africa

## Does the Reitfontein Fault classify as neotectonic or paleoseismic based on current evidence?

The Reitfontein Fault does not meet the conventional criteria for neotectonic classification but instead appears to be a paleoseismic structure with minor present-day activity. A neotectonic fault is defined as one that has hosted displacement under conditions imposed by the current crustal stress regime and therefore may move again in the future [@Crone1997]. The current crustal stress regime in South Africa was established sometime in the last 40 to 11 million years [@SouthDeep2025]. Active faults are conventionally defined as structures known to have produced historical earthquakes or shown evidence of movement in the last 35,000 years [@SouthDeep2025].

The Reitfontein Fault is at least 2.0 Ga old and has accommodated both normal and oblique reverse movement in the geological past [@SouthDeep2025]. There is no known geological or geomorphological evidence to suggest neotectonic activity on this structure [@SouthDeep2025]. The fault has only been associated with minor present-day seismic activity according to Singh et al. (2009) and references therein [@SouthDeep2025]. The characterization as a reportedly active fault with an assigned slip rate of 1 m/Myr represents a conservative engineering assumption rather than empirical evidence of neotectonic displacement [@SouthDeep2025].



## Is the 64 km rupture length assumption for $M_{\max} = 7.2$ calculation justified?

The 64 km rupture length assumption appears to be justified as a conservative estimate based on the mapped extent of the Reitfontein Fault, though the actual seismogenic length may be considerably shorter. The fault is documented as spanning 64 km, dipping to the north, and being oriented approximately east-west [@SouthDeep2025]. This length represents the surface expression of the structure identified through geological mapping and mine subsurface data [@SouthDeep2025].

The $M_{\max}$ of 7.2 assigned to the Reitfontein Fault has been determined using the relationship published in Wells and Coppersmith (1994) [@SouthDeep2025]. Wells and Coppersmith (1994) developed empirical relationships among moment magnitude, surface rupture length, subsurface rupture length, and rupture area based on a global compilation of historical earthquakes [@WellsCoppersmith1994]. Log-linear regressions between earthquake magnitude and surface rupture length showed strong correlations with standard deviations of 0.25 to 0.35 magnitude units [@WellsCoppersmith1994].

For a 64 km fault length and normal mechanism, the Wells and Coppersmith (1994) scaling relationship yields $M_{\max} = 7.2$ [@SouthDeep2025]. However, several considerations affect the appropriateness of this estimate for the Reitfontein Fault. First, not all mapped fault length necessarily represents seismogenic length capable of rupturing in a single earthquake. Second, stable continental region earthquakes may exhibit different scaling relationships than the predominantly active tectonic region earthquakes that dominate the Wells and Coppersmith dataset [@Somerville2021]. Third, the 64 km length likely includes segments that are favorably oriented in the current stress regime as well as segments that may be less likely to rupture [@SouthDeep2025].

The inclusion of uncertainties in the PSHA methodology helps address these concerns. The fault source modeling employs a logic tree approach with three different b-values weighted at 0.30, 0.60, and 0.10 [@SouthDeep2025], which captures epistemic uncertainty in the magnitude-frequency distribution. The use of the full 64 km length in calculating $M_{\max}$ represents a conservative upper bound assumption appropriate for safety-critical infrastructure such as tailings storage facilities [@SouthDeep2025].

## Can mining-induced seismicity trigger rupture of the entire 64 km Reitfontein Fault length?

Mining-induced seismicity is highly unlikely to trigger rupture of the entire 64 km Reitfontein Fault, though it may contribute to stress perturbations that reactivate segments of the structure. Mining-induced seismicity in the Witwatersrand Basin, where South Deep Mine is located, falls into two main categories: collapsing of highly stressed rock masses and shear or rupture along geological planes of weakness such as faults, joints, and dykes [@MiningNews2015]. The largest mining-related seismic event ever to occur in South Africa registered magnitude 5.3 on March 9, 2005 [@MiningNews2015].

The mechanism by which mining influences seismicity involves stress redistribution due to excavation at deep levels, which may result in fracture initiation and movement along pre-existing fracture planes [@Yang2015]. Mining-induced seismicity is generated by the abrupt release of elastic strain energy and fault slip due to interaction of tectonic and mining-related stresses [@Yang2015]. Most seismic events associated with mining are localized to the mining area and adjacent structures [@MiningNews2015].

The Pretorius Fault provides an instructive comparison. This structure ruptured during the 2004 M2.2 TauTona Mine earthquake, with exposures within mine tunnels showing that segments of the fault were reactivated [@SouthDeep2025]. However, the rupture was limited to local segments rather than the entire mapped fault length of 10 km [@SouthDeep2025]. The Reitfontein Fault, spanning 64 km at a distance of 43 km from the South Deep Mine site [@SouthDeep2025], is substantially farther from mining operations than the Pretorius Fault at 18 km [@SouthDeep2025].

The PSHA study methodology acknowledges the complexity of mining-induced seismicity by excluding events suspected of being mining-related with magnitudes less than M4.0 in order to minimize the influence of induced seismicity in hazard estimates [@SouthDeep2025]. A comprehensive assessment would require attempting to separate local forced and triggered induced seismicity from naturally occurring tectonic seismicity and treating these as separate logic branches [@SouthDeep2025]. The minor present-day seismic activity associated with the Reitfontein Fault according to Singh et al. (2009) [@SouthDeep2025] likely represents this type of stress perturbation rather than evidence of capability for large-magnitude rupture.

## What seismogenic depth assumptions apply to the Reitfontein Fault?



The basement geology at the South Deep Mine site consists of the Archaean Kaapvaal Craton, a granite and greenstone unit overlain by metamorphosed sediments and volcanics [@SouthDeep2025]. The site is located at the northern margin of the late Archaean to Paleoproterozoic Witwatersrand Basin [@SouthDeep2025]. Mining in the Witwatersrand Basin currently approaches depths of 4,000 meters, and seismicity associated with mining has been recorded at these deep levels [@Yang2015]. Studies of mining-induced earthquakes have examined events in deep gold mines using broadband records [@SouthDeep2025], indicating that seismic activity can occur at significant depths in this geological setting.

The Reitfontein Fault is documented as dipping to the north [@SouthDeep2025] with a dip of 35 degrees [@SouthDeep2025]. For a fault with this geometry spanning 64 km in length, the downdip width and depth extent would depend on the depth to the base of the seismogenic zone. In stable continental regions with thick lithosphere, seismogenic depths typically extend to 15-25 km, though this varies depending on the thermal structure and rheology of the crust [@SteinMazzotti2012].



## What slip-rate evidence exists for the 1 m/Myr assumption?



The Pretorius Fault, which is classified as active and has demonstrated recent reactivation during mine seismicity, is also assigned a slip rate of 1 m/Myr in the absence of published estimates [@SouthDeep2025].



The absence of quantified slip-rate data for the Reitfontein Fault reflects the general paucity of paleoseismic studies on South African faults. A field investigation would be required to improve understanding of faults near the South Deep Mine site and to reduce uncertainties associated with the activity rates of the active structures included in the study [@SouthDeep2025]. Paleoseismic investigations could include trenching across the fault trace to identify evidence of surface-rupturing earthquakes, dating of displaced geological units, or analysis of geomorphological features indicative of cumulative displacement [@Crone1997SCR].

## How do the Gutenberg-Richter parameters (a, b values) influence $M_{\max}$ probability?



- The parameter $a_0$ represents the number of earthquakes of magnitude zero or greater and defines the overall activity rate [@SouthDeep2025]. The seismicity parameters $A_0$ and $b$ are determined using available earthquake data [@SouthDeep2025]. Because of the low probability of very large earthquakes, $M_{\max}$ does not critically affect ground motion recurrence estimates for return periods up to hundreds of years, especially when the b-value is high [@SouthDeep2025].

## How does $M_{\max} = 7.2$ for the Reitfontein Fault compare to other South African stable continental region faults?

The $M_{\max} = 7.2$ assigned to the Reitfontein Fault represents an unusually high value for the South African stable continental region and exceeds most instrumentally observed cratonic seismicity. South Africa is located in a stable continental region (SCR) with the largest recorded earthquake being the Ceres event of September 29, 1969, with magnitude $M_w$ 6.2 [@Midzi2019]. This historical maximum is substantially lower than the $M_{\max} = 7.2$ assumed for the Reitfontein Fault.

Research on stable continental regions has found that Archean and Early Proterozoic cratonic lithosphere with higher than average shear-wave velocity have fewer crustal earthquakes and a lower value of the maximum moment magnitude [@SteinMazzotti2012]. No earthquakes with $M_w > 6$ have occurred above mantle lithosphere with $\delta V_S > 3.5\%$, and for cratonic interiors with seismically determined thick lithosphere, the maximum moment magnitude found in the earthquake catalog is $M_{cmax} = 6.0$ [@SteinMazzotti2012]. The Kaapvaal Craton, where the Reitfontein Fault is located, is an Archean craton formed between 2.7 and 3.7 Ga [@Midzi2019], placing it squarely in this category of stable, thick lithosphere with potentially limited seismogenic capacity.

However, paleoseismic evidence from stable continental regions globally indicates that prehistoric earthquakes may have greatly exceeded maximum observed instrumental magnitudes [@Midzi2019]. Studies have identified normal fault scarps in SCRs interpreted as having failed in large ($M_w > 7$) earthquakes [@Midzi2019]. Australia, which is analogous to South Africa as a stable continental region, boasts arguably the richest Late Neogene to Quaternary faulting record in SCR crust anywhere in the world [@ClarkMcCue2023], with some paleoseismic evidence for events exceeding $M_w$ 7.

Within the South Africa PSHA study area, the EZ-FRISK Africa model assigns $M_{\max}$ values of 7.23 for the Drakensberg zone and 7.0 for the Kaapvaal zone [@SouthDeep2025], while the GEM ZAF model uses values ranging from 5.28 to 6.38 for various zones [@SouthDeep2025]. The Pretorius Fault, with a 10 km length, is assigned $M_{\max} = 5.7$ [@SouthDeep2025], demonstrating the strong sensitivity of maximum magnitude estimates to fault dimensions via the Wells-Coppersmith relationships.

The assignment of $M_{\max} = 7.2$ to a 64 km fault in a cratonic setting represents a conservative engineering approach appropriate for safety-critical infrastructure but may exceed the realistic seismogenic potential based on the instrumental and paleoseismic record of the Kaapvaal Craton specifically.

## What is the regional $M_{\max}$ context from seismicity models and how does it constrain fault-specific values?

The regional $M_{\max}$ context from seismicity models employed in the South Deep PSHA study reveals substantial variability in maximum magnitude assumptions, which reflects epistemic uncertainty in stable continental region seismogenic potential. The PSHA employs three different earthquake recurrence models: EZ-FRISK's Africa model, the Global Earthquake Model's (GEM) South Africa (ZAF) model, and a smoothed seismicity model developed specifically for the study [@SouthDeep2025]. Each model assigns different $M_{\max}$ values to area sources based on tectonic setting and seismicity characteristics.

The EZ-FRISK Africa model assigns $M_{\max}$ values of 7.23 to the Drakensberg zone (820,725 km²) and 7.0 to the Kaapvaal zone (281,858 km²) [@SouthDeep2025]. These zones have b-values of 1.04 and 1.06 respectively [@SouthDeep2025], indicating a moderate ratio of small to large events. The GEM ZAF model employs more conservative $M_{\max}$ estimates, with the CEDAR zone assigned values of 5.73 (weight 0.35), 6.08 (weight 0.35), and 6.54 (weight 0.30) [@SouthDeep2025]. The ZEBED zone, which includes the study area, has $M_{\max}$ values of 5.28 (weight 0.45), 5.53 (weight 0.35), and 5.93 (weight 0.20) [@SouthDeep2025]. These lower values reflect a more conservative assessment of seismogenic potential in the Kaapvaal Craton interior.

The maximum credible earthquake magnitude $M_{\max}$ is not constrained by seismicity data but has been estimated from the tectonic setting by each earthquake recurrence model's authors [@SouthDeep2025]. Disaggregation of the hazard generally shows that the majority of hazard, at least for moderate return periods, comes from lower magnitudes and is not unduly affected by the choice of $M_{\max}$ [@SouthDeep2025]. This is particularly true when the b-value is high, as higher b-values indicate a greater proportion of smaller earthquakes.

For fault sources specifically, $M_{\max}$ is assigned depending on the length of surface expression according to Wells and Coppersmith (1994) [@SouthDeep2025]. The methodology determines minimum magnitude $M_{min}$ by subtracting a value from $M_{\max}$ that depends on the magnitude range: for $M_{\max}$ between 6.5 and 7.4, $M_{min} = M_{\max} - 1.5$, yielding a range of 5.0 to 5.9 [@SouthDeep2025]. This means the Reitfontein Fault with $M_{\max} = 7.2$ would have $M_{min} = 5.7$.

The regional models provide an important constraint on fault-specific $M_{\max}$ values through the area source zones that encompass each fault. If a fault's assigned $M_{\max}$ substantially exceeds the regional area source $M_{\max}$, this implies the fault is being treated as a special case capable of generating larger earthquakes than the distributed seismicity in the surrounding region. For the Reitfontein Fault, $M_{\max} = 7.2$ falls within the range of regional area source values (particularly the EZ-FRISK Drakensberg $M_{\max} = 7.23$) but exceeds the more conservative GEM ZAF ZEBED zone estimates. This highlights the epistemic uncertainty inherent in assigning maximum magnitudes to infrequently active structures in stable continental regions.
