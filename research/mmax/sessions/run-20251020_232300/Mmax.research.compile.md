# Analysis of $M_{\max} = 7.2$ for the Reitfontein Fault at South Deep Mine, South Africa

## Does the Reitfontein Fault classify as neotectonic or paleoseismic based on current evidence?

The current crustal stress regime in South Africa was established sometime in the last 40 to 11 million years [@SRC2025]. Active faults are conventionally defined as structures known to have produced historical earthquakes or shown evidence of movement in the last 35,000 years [@SRC2025].
The characterization as a reportedly active fault with an assigned slip rate of 1 m/Myr represents a conservative engineering assumption rather than empirical evidence of neotectonic displacement [@SRC2025].

In stable continental regions like South Africa, faults may exhibit episodic behavior with recurrence intervals of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years between ground-rupturing events [@SRC2025]. 

## Is the 64 km rupture length assumption for $M_{\max} = 7.2$ calculation justified?



Log-linear regressions between earthquake magnitude and surface rupture length showed strong correlations with standard deviations of 0.25 to 0.35 magnitude units [@WellsCoppersmith1994].



The inclusion of uncertainties in the PSHA methodology helps address these concerns. The fault source modeling employs a logic tree approach with three different b-values weighted at 0.30, 0.60, and 0.10 [@SRC2025], which captures epistemic uncertainty in the magnitude-frequency distribution. The use of the full 64 km length in calculating $M_{\max}$ represents a conservative upper bound assumption appropriate for safety-critical infrastructure such as tailings storage facilities [@SRC2025].

## Can mining-induced seismicity trigger rupture of the entire 64 km Reitfontein Fault length?

Mining-induced seismicity is highly unlikely to trigger rupture of the entire 64 km Reitfontein Fault, though it may contribute to stress perturbations that reactivate segments of the structure. Mining-induced seismicity in the Witwatersrand Basin, where South Deep Mine is located, falls into two main categories: collapsing of highly stressed rock masses and shear or rupture along geological planes of weakness such as faults, joints, and dykes [@EngineeringNews2015]. The largest mining-related seismic event ever to occur in South Africa registered magnitude 5.3 on March 9, 2005 [@EngineeringNews2015].

The mechanism by which mining influences seismicity involves stress redistribution due to excavation at deep levels, which may result in fracture initiation and movement along pre-existing fracture planes [@ScienceDirect2015]. Mining-induced seismicity is generated by the abrupt release of elastic strain energy and fault slip due to interaction of tectonic and mining-related stresses [@ScienceDirect2015]. Most seismic events associated with mining are localized to the mining area and adjacent structures [@EngineeringNews2015].

The PSHA study methodology acknowledges the complexity of mining-induced seismicity by excluding events suspected of being mining-related with magnitudes less than M4.0 in order to minimize the influence of induced seismicity in hazard estimates [@SRC2025]. A comprehensive assessment would require attempting to separate local forced and triggered induced seismicity from naturally occurring tectonic seismicity and treating these as separate logic branches [@SRC2025]. The minor present-day seismic activity associated with the Reitfontein Fault according to Singh et al. (2009) [@SRC2025] likely represents this type of stress perturbation rather than evidence of capability for large-magnitude rupture.

## What is the regional $M_{\max}$ context from seismicity models and how does it constrain fault-specific values?

The regional $M_{\max}$ context from seismicity models employed in the South Deep PSHA study reveals substantial variability in maximum magnitude assumptions, which reflects epistemic uncertainty in stable continental region seismogenic potential. The PSHA employs three different earthquake recurrence models: EZ-FRISK's Africa model, the Global Earthquake Model's (GEM) South Africa (ZAF) model, and a smoothed seismicity model developed specifically for the study [@SRC2025]. Each model assigns different $M_{\max}$ values to area sources based on tectonic setting and seismicity characteristics.

The EZ-FRISK Africa model assigns $M_{\max}$ values of 7.23 to the Drakensberg zone (820,725 km²) and 7.0 to the Kaapvaal zone (281,858 km²) [@SRC2025]. These zones have b-values of 1.04 and 1.06 respectively [@SRC2025], indicating a moderate ratio of small to large events. The GEM ZAF model employs more conservative $M_{\max}$ estimates, with the CEDAR zone assigned values of 5.73 (weight 0.35), 6.08 (weight 0.35), and 6.54 (weight 0.30) [@SRC2025]. The ZEBED zone, which includes the study area, has $M_{\max}$ values of 5.28 (weight 0.45), 5.53 (weight 0.35), and 5.93 (weight 0.20) [@SRC2025]. These lower values reflect a more conservative assessment of seismogenic potential in the Kaapvaal Craton interior.

The maximum credible earthquake magnitude $M_{\max}$ is not constrained by seismicity data but has been estimated from the tectonic setting by each earthquake recurrence model's authors [@SRC2025]. Disaggregation of the hazard generally shows that the majority of hazard, at least for moderate return periods, comes from lower magnitudes and is not unduly affected by the choice of $M_{\max}$ [@SRC2025]. This is particularly true when the b-value is high, as higher b-values indicate a greater proportion of smaller earthquakes.

For fault sources specifically, $M_{\max}$ is assigned depending on the length of surface expression according to Wells and Coppersmith (1994) [@SRC2025]. The methodology determines minimum magnitude $M_{min}$ by subtracting a value from $M_{\max}$ that depends on the magnitude range: for $M_{\max}$ between 6.5 and 7.4, $M_{min} = M_{\max} - 1.5$, yielding a range of 5.0 to 5.9 [@SRC2025]. This means the Reitfontein Fault with $M_{\max} = 7.2$ would have $M_{min} = 5.7$.

The regional models provide an important constraint on fault-specific $M_{\max}$ values through the area source zones that encompass each fault. If a fault's assigned $M_{\max}$ substantially exceeds the regional area source $M_{\max}$, this implies the fault is being treated as a special case capable of generating larger earthquakes than the distributed seismicity in the surrounding region. For the Reitfontein Fault, $M_{\max} = 7.2$ falls within the range of regional area source values (particularly the EZ-FRISK Drakensberg $M_{\max} = 7.23$) but exceeds the more conservative GEM ZAF ZEBED zone estimates. This highlights the epistemic uncertainty inherent in assigning maximum magnitudes to infrequently active structures in stable continental regions.

## How does $M_{\max} = 7.2$ for the Reitfontein Fault compare to other South African stable continental region faults?

The $M_{\max} = 7.2$ assigned to the Reitfontein Fault represents an unusually high value for the South African stable continental region and exceeds most instrumentally observed cratonic seismicity. South Africa is located in a stable continental region (SCR) with the largest recorded earthquake being the Ceres event of September 29, 1969, with magnitude $M_w$ 6.2 [@Manzunzu2019]. This historical maximum is substantially lower than the $M_{\max} = 7.2$ assumed for the Reitfontein Fault.

Research on stable continental regions has found that Archean and Early Proterozoic cratonic lithosphere with higher than average shear-wave velocity have fewer crustal earthquakes and a lower value of the maximum moment magnitude [@SteinMazzotti2012]. No earthquakes with $M_w > 6$ have occurred above mantle lithosphere with $\delta V_S > 3.5\%$, and for cratonic interiors with seismically determined thick lithosphere, the maximum moment magnitude found in the earthquake catalog is $M_{cmax} = 6.0$ [@SteinMazzotti2012]. The Kaapvaal Craton, where the Reitfontein Fault is located, is an Archean craton formed between 2.7 and 3.7 Ga [@Manzunzu2019], placing it squarely in this category of stable, thick lithosphere with potentially limited seismogenic capacity.

However, paleoseismic evidence from stable continental regions globally indicates that prehistoric earthquakes may have greatly exceeded maximum observed instrumental magnitudes [@Manzunzu2019]. Studies have identified normal fault scarps in SCRs interpreted as having failed in large ($M_w > 7$) earthquakes [@Manzunzu2019]. Australia, which is analogous to South Africa as a stable continental region, boasts arguably the richest Late Neogene to Quaternary faulting record in SCR crust anywhere in the world [@Clark2023], with some paleoseismic evidence for events exceeding $M_w$ 7.

Within the South Africa PSHA study area, the EZ-FRISK Africa model assigns $M_{\max}$ values of 7.23 for the Drakensberg zone and 7.0 for the Kaapvaal zone [@SRC2025], while the GEM ZAF model uses values ranging from 5.28 to 6.38 for various zones [@SRC2025]. The Pretorius Fault, with a 10 km length, is assigned $M_{\max} = 5.7$ [@SRC2025], demonstrating the strong sensitivity of maximum magnitude estimates to fault dimensions via the Wells-Coppersmith relationships.

The assignment of $M_{\max} = 7.2$ to a 64 km fault in a cratonic setting represents a conservative engineering approach appropriate for safety-critical infrastructure but may exceed the realistic seismogenic potential based on the instrumental and paleoseismic record of the Kaapvaal Craton specifically.

## What slip-rate evidence exists for the 1 m/Myr assumption?

No empirical slip-rate evidence exists for the Reitfontein Fault; the 1 m/Myr value is an engineering assumption assigned in the absence of published data. The PSHA study explicitly states that no slip rate has been published for this reportedly active fault, and therefore a slip rate of 1 m/Myr is assigned [@SRC2025]. This represents the minimum conservative value typically used for faults that show evidence of activity but lack quantified slip-rate measurements.

The assignment of 1 m/Myr places the Reitfontein Fault at the lower end of the slip-rate spectrum for active structures in South Africa. For comparison, some of the more active faults in South Africa have slip rates in the order of 200 m/Myr, such as the Kango Fault [@SRC2025]. The Pretorius Fault, which is classified as active and has demonstrated recent reactivation during mine seismicity, is also assigned a slip rate of 1 m/Myr in the absence of published estimates [@SRC2025].

The methodology for assigning slip rates in PSHA studies follows a hierarchical approach. When possible, slip rates are applied based on previously determined values from geological or geodetic studies [@SRC2025]. When slip rates are not quantified, they are estimated based on all other available data [@SRC2025]. For bedrock faults that do not show evidence of movement in the last 10 million years but are included due to favorable orientation in the current stress regime, a low uplift rate of 1 m/Myr is assigned [@SRC2025].

The absence of quantified slip-rate data for the Reitfontein Fault reflects the general paucity of paleoseismic studies on South African faults. A field investigation would be required to improve understanding of faults near the South Deep Mine site and to reduce uncertainties associated with the activity rates of the active structures included in the study [@SRC2025]. Paleoseismic investigations could include trenching across the fault trace to identify evidence of surface-rupturing earthquakes, dating of displaced geological units, or analysis of geomorphological features indicative of cumulative displacement [@ScienceDirect1999].

## How do the Gutenberg-Richter parameters (a, b values) influence $M_{\max}$ probability?

The Gutenberg-Richter b-value fundamentally controls the relative probability of different magnitude earthquakes but does not directly determine $M_{\max}$ itself. The Gutenberg-Richter seismicity recurrence equation states that $\log_{10}(n) = a_0 - b \times M$, where $b$ is the Richter b-value representing the relative proportion of small to large events, $M$ is earthquake magnitude, and $n$ is the number of earthquakes in magnitude range $M \pm \Delta M$ [@SRC2025]. Above a given maximum magnitude $M_{\max}$, the rate is assumed to be zero [@SRC2025].

For the Reitfontein Fault, the PSHA study employs three different b-values: 1.35 (weighted 0.30), 1.10 (weighted 0.60), and 1.99 (weighted 0.10) [@SRC2025]. The b-value affects the slope of the magnitude-frequency distribution, with higher b-values indicating a greater proportion of smaller earthquakes relative to larger ones. A lower b-value means that the ratio of large to small earthquakes is higher, which increases the probability of larger magnitude events approaching $M_{\max}$ occurring within a given time period.

The parameter $a_0$ represents the number of earthquakes of magnitude zero or greater and defines the overall activity rate [@SRC2025]. The seismicity parameters $A_0$ and $b$ are determined using available earthquake data [@SRC2025]. Because of the low probability of very large earthquakes, $M_{\max}$ does not critically affect ground motion recurrence estimates for return periods up to hundreds of years, especially when the b-value is high [@SRC2025].

The weighted mean approach using multiple b-values captures epistemic uncertainty in the magnitude-frequency distribution. The dominant weight of 0.60 on the intermediate b-value of 1.10 suggests this is considered the most representative value for the Reitfontein Fault based on regional seismicity characteristics. The high b-value of 1.99 with low weight of 0.10 represents a scenario where earthquake activity is dominated by smaller events, making approach to $M_{\max} = 7.2$ highly improbable. Conversely, the lower b-value of 1.35 with weight 0.30 increases the relative probability of larger magnitude events.

The practical effect on hazard is that earthquakes approaching $M_{\max}$ contribute minimally to short-return-period ground motions due to their extreme rarity, as evidenced by disaggregation analyses showing that the majority of hazard comes from lower magnitudes [@SRC2025]. The $M_{\max}$ value primarily influences long-return-period hazard estimates (10,000 years and beyond) and deterministic scenario analyses.

## Validation of the Singh et al. 2009 reference

The Singh et al. (2009) reference cited in the South Deep report is a synthesis paper titled "Seismotectonic models for South Africa: Synthesis of geoscientific information, problems, and the way forward" published in Seismological Research Letters [@SRC2025]. External validation confirms that Singh et al. (2009) specifically identified the Reitfontein Fault as one of several faults requiring reassessment to determine if still active, alongside the Thabazimbi, Zebediela, Zoetfontein, Dreyling, Hebron, and Cedarville faults [@ResearchGate2009a; @ResearchGate2009b].

The South Deep report's use of the phrase "and references therein" when citing Singh et al. (2009) suggests this is a secondary citation rather than primary observational data [@SRC2025]. Singh's paper represents a comprehensive review synthesizing geoscientific information to explain earthquake clusters across South Africa [@ResearchGate2009b]. The paper's identification of Reitfontein as requiring reassessment does not constitute evidence that Singh et al. classified the fault as active neotectonic; rather, it indicates the fault's activity status was uncertain and merited further investigation.

## Rupture depth requirements for $M_w=7.2$ with 64 km length





## Regional fault comparisons: context and benchmarks

The South Deep PSHA includes two fault sources in the Witwatersrand region: Reitfontein (64 km, 1 m/Myr, $M_{\max}=7.2$) and Pretorius (10 km, 1 m/Myr, $M_{\max}=5.7$) [@SRC2025]. The magnitude-length scaling follows Wells and Coppersmith (1994), with the 6.4-fold difference in fault length (64 km vs 10 km) producing a 1.5 magnitude unit difference [@SRC2025]. Both faults are assigned the same 1 m/Myr slip rate as a default value due to absence of published measurements [@SRC2025], despite the Pretorius Fault having documented reactivation during the 2004 M2.2 TauTona Mine earthquake [@SRC2025].

The Kango Fault in the southern Cape Fold Belt represents the benchmark for active South African faults, with measured slip rates on the order of 200 m/Myr [@SRC2025]. Paleoseismic investigations of the Kango Fault identified an early Holocene earthquake with magnitude $M_w$ 6.97-7.18 based on a 2.0±0.06 m fault scarp [@Goedhart2016]. This paleoseismic evidence demonstrates that earthquakes exceeding $M_w$ 7.0 are possible in South Africa, far exceeding the instrumental maximum of $M_w$ 6.2 from the 1969 Ceres earthquake [@Manzunzu2018]. The Kango Fault's 200 m/Myr slip rate is 200 times higher than Reitfontein's assigned rate, yet produces similar maximum magnitudes, creating an apparent paradox [@SRC2025; @Goedhart2016].

Current South African PSHA models assign $M_{\max}$ values ranging from 5.3-6.3 for most regional zones [@Goedhart2016], with area source zones in the South Deep region having $M_{\max}$ values of 7.23 for Drakensberg and Witwatersrand Basin zones, and 5.28-6.74 for the KVAAL zone [@SRC2025]. The Reitfontein Fault's $M_{\max}=7.2$ places it at the upper end of regional PSHA estimates [@SRC2025]. Paleoseismic studies emphasize the danger of over-reliance on instrumental catalogs, as the 150-year instrumental record captures only a small fraction of possible events in regions with recurrence intervals of 10,000-100,000+ years [@Goedhart2016].

Comparative data from other cratonic regions provides additional benchmarks. Australian SCR faults, which represent the richest documented SCR paleoseismic record globally, yield $M_{\max}$ estimates of 7.0-7.5 ± 0.2 based on multiple documented paleoearthquakes [@ResearchGate2014]. Cratonic interiors with thick seismogenic lithosphere show catalog maximum magnitudes ($M_{cmax}$) of approximately 6.0 for cold Archean/Early Proterozoic cratons [@SteinMazzotti2012], though this represents observed maximum rather than theoretical $M_{\max}$ for hazard assessment. The Kaapvaal Craton seismogenic structure, with documented activity at 5-16 km depth [@King2018], is consistent with these cratonic constraints.

Other neotectonic faults identified in the Kaapvaal Craton include the Zebediela Fault (associated with thermal springs), Thabazimbi Fault (lineament with seismic activity), and Moshaweng Fault (repeated extensional reactivations with recent inversion) [@Kolawole2016; @ResearchGate2009b]. The Kokstad-Koffiefontein Seismicity Belt is an E-W trending feature hosting 7 hot springs, and the Murchison Greenstone Belt is a lineament with documented natural seismicity [@Kolawole2016]. These structures share the Reitfontein characteristic of ancient (Archean-Paleoproterozoic) age with potential neotectonic reactivation, but unlike Reitfontein, several show geomorphic indicators (thermal springs) suggesting ongoing activity [@Kolawole2016]. No comprehensive fault catalog providing systematic slip rate and $M_{\max}$ data for all South African neotectonic and paleoseismic faults was identified in the literature review, representing a significant gap in regional hazard characterization.
