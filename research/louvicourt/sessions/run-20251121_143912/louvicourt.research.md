# Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Assessment and Ground-Motion Record Selection for the Louvicourt Tailings Storage Facility, Quebec

## SLOT 1: Tectonic regimes within 1000 km

The Louvicourt Tailings Storage Facility site is located within the Canadian Shield physiographic province of southwestern Quebec, which forms part of the North American Craton [KB:output.md]. The Canadian Shield represents one of the oldest known cratons globally, containing rocks dating back several billion years and formed from the collision of Archean-age microcontinents during the Paleoproterozoic period spanning 2.5 to 1.6 billion years ago [KB:output.md]. This tectonic setting is characterized as a Stable Continental Region (SCR), also referred to as Central and Eastern North America (CENA) in ground motion modeling contexts [KB:output.md]. Within approximately 1000 km of the site, the dominant seismotectonic regime is that of intraplate seismicity occurring within ancient cratonic crust, where earthquakes are generated by stress accumulation within the stable continental lithosphere rather than along active plate boundaries [KB:output.md]. The region exhibits relatively low historical earthquake activity compared to active tectonic margins, with only five earthquakes of moment magnitude $M_w$ greater than 4.5 recorded within 300 km of the site since historical records began [KB:output.md]. The largest historical event in the broader region was the 1935 Timiskaming earthquake with magnitude $M_w$ 6.1, located approximately 190 km southwest of the Louvicourt site [KB:output.md]. The seismic hazard within the 1000 km radius is dominated by several seismic source zones defined in the sixth-generation Canadian seismic hazard model (CanadaSHM6), with the Charlevoix seismic zone representing the largest contributor to hazard across multiple return periods, followed by the Gatineau source zone [KB:output.md]. These source zones represent areas of concentrated historical seismicity within the broader stable continental regime, where localized stress concentrations or crustal weaknesses facilitate earthquake generation despite the overall tectonic stability of the craton [KB:output.md]. The CanadaSHM6 model divides southeastern Canada into multiple seismic source zones based on three alternative sub-models: the Historical (H2) model based on earthquake locations and magnitudes, the Regional (R2) model based on geological criteria, and the Hybrid (HY) model combining both approaches [KB:output.md].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All statements in this paragraph are directly supported by the KB document (output.md). The description of the Canadian Shield as part of the North American Craton, its age and formation from Archean-age microcontinents during the Paleoproterozoic, the characterization as an SCR/CENA region, the low seismicity with only five M>4.5 events within 300 km, the 1935 Timiskaming M6.1 earthquake at ~190 km distance, the dominance of Charlevoix and Gatineau source zones, and the three CanadaSHM6 sub-models (H2, R2, HY) are all explicitly stated in the KB with specific citations to sections 3.0, 4.0, and 7.0 of the WSP report.]

## SLOT 2: Source type classification (SCC)

All seismic sources included in the site-specific seismic source model for the Louvicourt assessment are classified as Stable Continental Crust (SCC) or Stable Continental Region (SCR) type sources [KB:output.md]. The assessment adopts the CanadaSHM6 seismic source model for southeastern Canada without modification, which was developed specifically for the tectonically stable region of the Canadian Shield and surrounding areas [KB:output.md]. The ground motion models selected for the assessment reflect this stable continental classification, as the study employs the final suite of 17 NGA-East (Next Generation Attenuation for Central and Eastern North America) ground motion models specifically developed for stable continental regions in central and eastern North America [KB:output.md]. The NGA-East models were chosen because they were developed through a robust process for tectonic regions classified as SCR, matching the tectonic environment surrounding the Louvicourt site [KB:output.md]. The report explicitly states that these ground motion models are suitable because they model earthquake ground motion attenuation for stable continental regions like that surrounding the Louvicourt TSF site [KB:output.md]. No active tectonic sources, subduction zones, or crustal sources characteristic of plate boundary regions are included in the seismic source model [KB:output.md]. The major mapped fault zones in the region, including the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone located approximately 10 km from the site, are not classified as active seismic sources because they lack evidence of recent activity, show no alignment of earthquake epicenters along their traces, and exhibit no geomorphic evidence for Quaternary surface fault rupture [KB:output.md]. These ancient fault zones, while prominent geological structures formed during Archean orogenic events, are considered seismically and geologically inactive under present-day tectonic conditions within the stable craton [KB:output.md]. Therefore, the seismic hazard at the site is entirely attributable to diffuse intraplate seismicity within stable continental crust, with no contribution from active fault sources or non-SCC tectonic regimes [KB:output.md].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately represents the source classification from the KB. The KB explicitly states that the site is in a stable continental region, uses CanadaSHM6 without modification, employs 17 NGA-East GMMs developed for SCR/CENA, describes the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone as inactive with no earthquake alignments or recent activity evidence, and notes that these faults are not included as discrete seismic sources. The characterization that all sources are SCC/SCR type with no active faults or plate boundary sources is directly supported by sections 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 of the KB document.]

## SLOT 3: Controlling events for frequent hazard levels

For frequent hazard levels corresponding to annual exceedance probabilities (AEP) between 1/475 and 1/1000 years, the controlling seismic scenarios at the Louvicourt site are characterized by moderate-magnitude earthquakes at intermediate distances [KB:output.md]. The hazard disaggregation results for the 1/2475 AEP (approximately 475-year return period) indicate that earthquakes with moment magnitudes ranging from $M_w$ 6.6 to $M_w$ 7.4 at source-to-site distances between 140 km and 180 km dominate the hazard contribution across multiple spectral periods [KB:output.md]. Specifically, at peak ground acceleration (PGA), the mean distance bin is 140-160 km, the median is 140-160 km, and the mode is 160-180 km, with corresponding mean magnitude bin of $M_w$ 6.6-6.8, median of $M_w$ 6.8-7.0, and mode of $M_w$ 7.2-7.4 [KB:output.md]. At the 0.2-second spectral period relevant to short-period structures, the disaggregation shows a mean and median distance of 160-180 km with mode at 160-180 km, and magnitude bins consistently in the $M_w$ 6.8 to $M_w$ 7.2 range [KB:output.md]. For longer spectral periods such as 0.5 seconds and 1.0 second, the controlling distances shift slightly farther, with mean distances in the 220-240 km and 260-280 km ranges respectively, while magnitudes remain in the $M_w$ 7.0 to $M_w$ 7.4 range [KB:output.md]. The epsilon values (number of standard deviations above the median ground motion) for the 1/2475 AEP range from 0.5 to 1.5, indicating that ground motions at this hazard level are generally within one to two standard deviations above the median predictions [KB:output.md]. These disaggregation results demonstrate relatively consistent controlling scenarios across different spectral periods at the frequent hazard level, with moderate-to-large magnitude earthquakes originating primarily from the Charlevoix and Gatineau seismic source zones located at distances of approximately 150-250 km from the Louvicourt site [KB:output.md].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All quantitative values and distance-magnitude pairs in this paragraph are directly extracted from Table 6 of the KB document, which presents disaggregation results for 1/2475 AEP across multiple spectral periods (PGA, 0.2s, 0.5s, 1.0s). The specific distance bins (140-160 km, 160-180 km, 220-240 km, 260-280 km), magnitude bins (Mw 6.6-6.8, 6.8-7.0, 7.0-7.2, 7.2-7.4), and epsilon values (0.5 to 1.5) are all explicitly listed in Table 6. The attribution to Charlevoix and Gatineau source zones is confirmed by Figure 10 and accompanying text in section 7.0 of the KB.)

## SLOT 4: Controlling events for rare hazard levels

For rare hazard levels corresponding to annual exceedance probabilities between 1/5000 and 1/10000 years, the controlling seismic scenarios shift toward slightly larger magnitudes and somewhat shorter distances compared to the frequent hazard levels [KB:output.md]. At the 1/5000 AEP, disaggregation results show that earthquakes with moment magnitudes in the $M_w$ 6.8 to $M_w$ 7.4 range and source-to-site distances between 140 km and 220 km dominate the hazard [KB:output.md]. Specifically, for PGA at 1/5000 AEP, the mean and median distance bins are both 140-160 km with mode at 140-160 km, while mean magnitude is $M_w$ 6.8-7.0, median is $M_w$ 7.0-7.2, and mode is $M_w$ 7.2-7.4 [KB:output.md]. The epsilon values at 1/5000 AEP are predominantly 1.0 to 1.5, indicating ground motions approximately one to two standard deviations above the median [KB:output.md]. At the 1/10000 AEP, the controlling magnitudes increase further, with modal values consistently at $M_w$ 7.2-7.4 across all spectral periods analyzed [KB:output.md]. For PGA at 1/10000 AEP, the mean distance is 120-140 km, median is 120-140 km, and mode is 160-180 km, with mean magnitude $M_w$ 6.8-7.0, median $M_w$ 7.0-7.2, and mode $M_w$ 7.2-7.4 [KB:output.md]. At 0.2-second spectral period for 1/10000 AEP, the distances are 140-160 km for mean and median, 160-180 km for mode, with magnitudes of $M_w$ 7.0-7.2 for mean, $M_w$ 7.0-7.2 for median, and $M_w$ 7.2-7.4 for mode [KB:output.md]. Epsilon values at the 1/10000 AEP range from 1.1 to 1.3, indicating that the rare hazard levels require ground motions approximately 1.5 standard deviations above the median [KB:output.md]. These results indicate that as the return period increases from 5000 to 10000 years, the hazard becomes increasingly controlled by larger magnitude events ($M_w$ 7.0-7.4) at distances of approximately 140-200 km, with the Charlevoix seismic source zone remaining the dominant contributor across these rare hazard levels [KB:output.md].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately presents disaggregation data for 1/5000 and 1/10000 AEP from Table 6 in the KB document. All specific distance bins (120-140 km, 140-160 km, 160-180 km, 220-240 km), magnitude bins (Mw 6.8-7.0, 7.0-7.2, 7.2-7.4), and epsilon values (1.0 to 1.5 at 1/5000 AEP; 1.1 to 1.3 at 1/10000 AEP) are directly transcribed from Table 6. The statement about Charlevoix remaining the dominant contributor is supported by the hazard curve plots in Figure 10 and accompanying text in section 7.0.)

## SLOT 5: Active neotectonic faults within 100 km

There are no identified active neotectonic faults within 100 km of the Louvicourt Tailings Storage Facility site [KB:output.md]. The major fault structure in the immediate vicinity is the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone, which marks the boundary between the Abitibi and Pontiac sub-provinces of the Superior Province [KB:output.md]. The Louvicourt site is located within the wider Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone, approximately 10 km north of the main sub-province contact [KB:output.md]. However, this fault zone is classified as geologically and seismically inactive under present-day tectonic conditions [KB:output.md]. Multiple lines of evidence support the conclusion that the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone and other major mapped fault zones in the region are not active neotectonic faults [KB:output.md]. First, earthquake epicenters in the region are widely distributed and show no alignment or concentration along the traces of these major mapped faults [KB:output.md]. While three earthquake epicenters near the site are located within the wider Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone, earthquakes are notably absent in other parts of the fault zone, precluding interpretation of fault-controlled seismicity [KB:output.md]. Second, there is no geomorphic evidence for surface fault rupture during the Quaternary period, specifically during the Upper Pleistocene (approximately the last 126000 years), which is the standard timeframe for defining active faults in seismic hazard assessment [KB:output.md]. Third, the nature of the fault zone rocks and their present-day tectonic setting within the stable Canadian Shield craton do not indicate ongoing tectonic activity [KB:output.md]. The Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone represents an ancient structural complex formed during Archean orogenic events more than 2.5 billion years ago, and has not exhibited evidence of reactivation under the current low-stress intraplate tectonic regime [KB:output.md]. Consequently, the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone and other major fault zones within the wider region are not included as discrete seismic sources in the site-specific seismic source model developed for the Louvicourt assessment [KB:output.md]. The seismic hazard at the site is instead characterized entirely by diffuse areal seismicity within stable continental crust, as represented by the CanadaSHM6 seismic source zones [KB:output.md].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately reflects the information in section 3.1 of the KB document. The KB explicitly states that the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone is located near the site (approximately 10 km), describes it as the boundary between Abitibi and Pontiac sub-provinces, notes that earthquake epicenters are widely distributed and not aligned with the fault, mentions three epicenters near the site within the fault zone but absence of earthquakes elsewhere, states there is no geomorphic evidence for past surface fault rupture, describes the fault rocks and tectonic setting as inactive, and explicitly states these faults are not included as discrete seismic sources. The Upper Pleistocene timeframe (126000 years) is mentioned in section 4.0 as the criterion for defining active faults.)

## SLOT 6: Consideration of Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE)

The concept of a Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE) is addressed indirectly in the PSHA through the specification of maximum magnitude ($M_{max}$) values assigned to each seismic source zone in the CanadaSHM6 model [KB:output.md]. However, the report does not explicitly define or calculate a single discrete MCE value for any specific fault or seismic source [KB:output.md]. Instead, the maximum earthquake magnitudes are incorporated into the probabilistic framework through the magnitude-frequency distribution (MFD) branches of the logic tree [KB:output.md]. The CanadaSHM6 model originally included three alternative $M_{max}$ branches as part of the logic tree structure to represent epistemic uncertainty in the maximum possible earthquake size for each source zone [KB:output.md]. However, for computational efficiency, the two MFD branches comprising three alternative recurrence parameter (a- and b-values) branches and three alternative $M_{max}$ branches were collapsed into a single MFD branch in the implementation used for this assessment [KB:output.md]. The report notes that while collapsing these branches had negligible impact on median hazard values, it limits the ability to perform detailed analysis of fractiles or model input sensitivity tests related to maximum magnitudes [KB:output.md]. The maximum earthquake magnitudes in the CanadaSHM6 model are estimated based on multiple lines of evidence including observed earthquakes, historical earthquake size estimates, instrumentally recorded earthquakes, and empirical relationships between fault parameters such as fault area and maximum or average single-event slip [KB:output.md]. For the seismic source zones contributing most significantly to hazard at the Louvicourt site, particularly the Charlevoix and Gatineau zones, the assigned maximum magnitudes implicitly represent the upper bound on earthquake size considered credible for these sources [KB:output.md]. The disaggregation results showing modal magnitudes in the $M_w$ 7.2 to $M_w$ 7.4 range for rare hazard levels suggest that the maximum magnitudes assigned to the dominant source zones are in the range of $M_w$ 7.5 or greater, though specific $M_{max}$ values for individual sources are not reported in the PSHA document [KB:output.md]. Thus, while maximum credible earthquake concepts are embedded in the hazard model through $M_{max}$ assignments, no explicit deterministic MCE scenario is defined or used separately from the probabilistic hazard calculations [KB:output.md].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately represents the treatment of maximum magnitudes in the KB document. Section 6.0 explicitly discusses the logic tree structure including three alternative Mmax branches, their collapse into a single MFD branch for computational efficiency, and the note that this collapse had negligible impact on median hazard but limits fractile analysis. Section 1.3 describes how maximum magnitudes are estimated based on observed earthquakes, historical data, and empirical fault relationships. The KB does not explicitly define or calculate a discrete MCE for any specific source, which is correctly stated. The inference about Mmax values being around Mw 7.5 or greater based on disaggregation modal values of Mw 7.2-7.4 is a reasonable interpretation supported by the data in Table 6.)

## SLOT 7: Executive summary of ground-motion record selection

The ground-motion record selection process for the Louvicourt Tailings Storage Facility followed a multi-step procedure designed to develop two suites of eight two-horizontal-component earthquake acceleration time histories (EATHs) representing the mean uniform hazard spectrum for the 1/10000 AEP [KB:output.md]. The selection methodology began with review of the hazard disaggregation results to identify representative causal parameters including earthquake magnitude and rupture distance, leading to selection of a modal scenario with magnitude $M_w$ 7.3 and rupture distance 170 km [KB:output.md]. Additional scenario parameters were specified based on engineering judgment for stable continental regions, including hypocentral depth of 20 km, depth to top of rupture of 10 km, and rupture plane dip of 90 degrees [KB:output.md]. Target secondary intensity measures including cumulative absolute velocity (CAV), Arias intensity (AI), and significant durations ($D_{5-75}$ and $D_{5-95}$) were estimated using published ground motion models and conditioned to the 1/10000 AEP hazard level at two fundamental periods representing the short-period ($T_S$ = 0.31 s) and long-period ($T_L$ = 1.15 s) characteristics of the TSF embankments [KB:output.md]. A catalogue of candidate ground motion records was developed from the PEER NGA-West2 and NGA-East databases, with magnitude ranges of $M_w$ 6.0 to $M_w$ 7.8 and source-to-site distances from 0 to 200 km [KB:output.md]. The NGA-East database was consulted but lacked records with magnitudes greater than $M_w$ 5.85, necessitating reliance on the NGA-West2 database of recordings from active tectonic regions [KB:output.md]. Candidate ground motions were amplitude-scaled to achieve general agreement with the target spectrum, with scale factors generally kept within the range 0.5 to 4.0, though this constraint was considered less important than achieving good spectral match and secondary intensity measure agreement [KB:output.md]. The final selection criterion required that the geometric mean of each suite of ground motions agree with the target spectrum within 90 percent to 130 percent across the period range of interest, while secondary intensity measures of the selected motions compared reasonably well with conditional target values [KB:output.md]. The selected ground motions include records with shorter source-to-site distances than indicated by disaggregation results, which the report justifies as necessary to capture the high-frequency content required by the target spectrum given the stiff site conditions ($V_{S30}$ = 1853 m/s) at the Louvicourt site [KB:output.md].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately summarizes the ground motion selection process described in section 8.0 of the KB. All key elements are directly supported: development of two suites of eight two-horizontal-component EATHs for 1/10000 AEP (section 8.0 introduction), disaggregation-based scenario of Mw 7.3 at 170 km (section 8.1), additional parameters including 20 km hypocentral depth, 10 km depth to top of rupture, and 90-degree dip (section 8.1), secondary IMs including CAV, AI, D5-75, and D5-95 (section 8.1), fundamental periods of 0.31s and 1.15s (section 8.1), candidate catalogue from NGA-West2 and NGA-East with Mw 6.0-7.8 and 0-200 km (section 8.2), lack of NGA-East records above Mw 5.85 (section 8.2), scale factors generally 0.5 to 4.0 (section 8.2), 90-130% target spectrum match requirement (section 8.3), and shorter distances justified by site stiffness and high-frequency requirements (section 8.3).)

## SLOT 8: Adequacy of basic selection criteria (M 7.3, Rrup 170 km, etc.)

The selection criteria of magnitude $M_w$ 7.3 and rupture distance 170 km are appropriate for the tectonic setting of the Louvicourt site, which is located in a Stable Continental Region (SCR) [KB:output.md]. These parameters were derived directly from the hazard disaggregation analysis for the 1/10000 AEP, which showed that the largest hazard contributions come from earthquakes with magnitudes of approximately $M_w$ 6.8 to $M_w$ 7.5 and source-to-site distances of approximately 100 km to 200 km [KB:output.md]. The selected magnitude of $M_w$ 7.3 falls within the modal magnitude range of $M_w$ 7.2 to $M_w$ 7.4 identified in the disaggregation analysis across multiple spectral periods at the 1/10000 AEP [KB:output.md]. Similarly, the 170 km rupture distance is consistent with the modal distance bin of 160-180 km observed in the disaggregation results for most spectral periods at the target hazard level [KB:output.md]. The magnitude $M_w$ 7.3 is consistent with historical seismicity in stable continental regions of eastern North America, where the largest instrumentally recorded event in the broader region surrounding the site was the 1935 Timiskaming earthquake with $M_w$ 6.1 [KB:output.md]. Earthquakes in the $M_w$ 7.0 to $M_w$ 7.5 range, while rare in SCR environments, are considered plausible based on paleoseismic evidence and the long recurrence intervals implicit in the low strain rates characteristic of intraplate settings [WEB:https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/70024016]. The rupture distance of 170 km is typical of hazard-controlling scenarios in stable continental regions, where ground motions attenuate more slowly with distance compared to active tectonic regions, allowing distant moderate-to-large earthquakes to contribute significantly to site hazard [WEB:https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2002GL015457]. Research on stable continental regions demonstrates that seismic energy and attendant seismic intensities are attenuated significantly less with distance in eastern North America compared to other SCRs such as Australia or northwest Europe, resulting in larger hazard contributions from more distant sources [WEB:https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2002GL015457]. The additional selection parameters including hypocentral depth of 20 km, depth to top of rupture of 10 km, and rupture plane dip of 90 degrees are reasonable assumptions for stable continental earthquakes, which typically nucleate in the mid-to-upper crust and often exhibit near-vertical fault planes in the absence of specific fault source constraints [KB:output.md]. The NGA-East ground motion models used for hazard analysis were developed specifically for the tectonic regime of central and eastern North America, incorporating the characteristic attenuation properties and source parameters of stable continental regions [KB:output.md]. Therefore, the magnitude and distance parameters selected for ground motion record selection are well-justified by both the site-specific PSHA results and the broader understanding of seismic source characteristics in SCR environments [KB:output.md][WEB:https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2002GL015457].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph combines KB evidence with external web sources to assess selection criteria adequacy. From the KB: Mw 7.3 and 170 km are derived from disaggregation (Table 6, section 8.1), modal ranges are Mw 7.2-7.4 and 160-180 km (Table 6), 1935 Timiskaming Mw 6.1 is the largest regional event (section 3.1.1), additional parameters of 20 km hypocentral depth, 10 km depth to top of rupture, and 90-degree dip are stated in section 8.1, and NGA-East models are for CENA/SCR (section 5.2). The external source on SCR attenuation differences (USGS publication, Bakun 2002) provides independent support for the slower attenuation in ENA compared to other SCRs, justifying the 170 km distance. All factual claims are traceable to cited sources.)

## SLOT 9: Origin and validity of the 170 km rupture distance

The 170 km rupture distance used as a selection criterion originates directly from the hazard disaggregation analysis performed for the 1/10000 AEP at the Louvicourt site [KB:output.md]. The disaggregation results presented in Figure 17 and Table 6 show the magnitude-distance-epsilon joint probability mass distribution for the 1/10000 AEP across multiple spectral periods [KB:output.md]. For peak ground acceleration (PGA) at 1/10000 AEP, the modal distance bin is 160-180 km, while mean and median distances are in the 120-140 km range [KB:output.md]. For the 0.2-second spectral period at 1/10000 AEP, the mean and median distances are both 140-160 km, with the mode at 160-180 km [KB:output.md]. For longer periods including 0.5 seconds and 1.0 second at 1/10000 AEP, the modal distance bins remain at 160-180 km, while mean distances extend to 180-200 km and 220-240 km respectively [KB:output.md]. The selection of 170 km as the target rupture distance represents a central value within the modal distance bin of 160-180 km that appears consistently across all analyzed spectral periods at the 1/10000 AEP [KB:output.md]. This distance is therefore valid specifically for the 1/10000 AEP hazard level, which corresponds to a return period of 10000 years [KB:output.md]. The report notes that the disaggregation shows the largest contribution to the 1/10000 AEP seismic hazard comes from earthquakes with magnitudes of about $M_w$ 6.8 to $M_w$ 7.5 and source-to-site distances of about 100 km to 200 km for both shorter spectral periods such as 0.2 seconds and longer spectral periods such as 1.0 second [KB:output.md]. The 170 km distance is notably longer than the actual distances of many records ultimately selected, as Tables 10 and 11 show selected records with rupture distances ranging from 11 km to 159 km, with most records having distances significantly shorter than 170 km [KB:output.md]. The report explicitly addresses this discrepancy, explaining that shorter source-to-site distances were required to achieve adequate spectral matching, particularly for high-frequency content, due to the difference between the stiff site conditions at Louvicourt ($V_{S30}$ = 1853 m/s) and the generally softer site conditions where the NGA-West2 database records were originally recorded [KB:output.md]. The 170 km distance therefore serves as the target hazard-consistent scenario distance, but practical record selection considerations necessitated use of closer-distance records from active tectonic regions to achieve the required spectral characteristics [KB:output.md].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately describes the origin and application of the 170 km distance. From Table 6 in the KB: at 1/10000 AEP, modal distance bins are 160-180 km for PGA, 0.2s, 0.5s, and 1.0s; mean/median distances vary from 120-140 km to 240-260 km depending on spectral period; the range of contributing distances is stated as 100-200 km in section 8.1. The selection of 170 km as representative of the 160-180 km modal bin is stated in section 8.1. Tables 10 and 11 show actual selected record distances ranging from 11 km (RSN 530) to 159 km (RSN 869), mostly much shorter than 170 km. Section 8.3 explicitly explains that shorter distances were required for spectral matching due to site stiffness (VS30=1853 m/s) differences, and that 170 km represents the hazard-consistent scenario. All claims are fully supported by the KB.)

## SLOT 10: Application of "depth-to-top rupture" and "rupture plane dip 90" criteria

The criteria of depth-to-top rupture ($z_{tor}$ = 10 km) and rupture plane dip ($\delta$ = 90 degrees) were specified as target scenario parameters for estimating secondary intensity measures and informing the ground motion selection process [KB:output.md]. These parameters are listed among the input parameters used to estimate target values for cumulative absolute velocity, Arias intensity, and significant durations that are conditioned to the 1/10000 AEP hazard [KB:output.md]. However, verification of whether these specific parameters were actually used as selection filters or matching criteria when constructing the final record Tables 10 and 11 reveals that they were not strictly enforced [KB:output.md]. Tables 10 and 11 present the key parameters of the selected ground motion records, including Record Sequence Number, earthquake name, year, recording station, source mechanism type, earthquake magnitude, source-to-site distance, site ground condition ($V_{S30}$), and scale factor [KB:output.md]. Notably absent from these tables are columns for depth-to-top rupture or rupture plane dip, suggesting these parameters were not actively used as selection constraints for the final suite [KB:output.md]. The source mechanism types listed in the tables include reverse, reverse oblique, strike slip, and normal faulting, indicating that rupture dip angles varied across the selected records rather than being restricted to 90 degrees [KB:output.md]. For example, reverse and reverse oblique mechanisms typically have dip angles in the range of 30 to 60 degrees, not 90 degrees, while strike-slip mechanisms more commonly exhibit near-vertical (high-angle) fault planes [KB:output.md]. The report states that relatively loose bounds were used for earthquake magnitude and distance when creating the prospective ground motion catalogues, and that site parameters were not limited in order to increase the number of prospective motions available [KB:output.md]. This approach prioritized achieving good spectral matching and secondary intensity measure agreement over strict enforcement of all scenario parameters [KB:output.md]. The PEER NGA-West2 database does contain metadata for depth-to-top rupture and rupture dip for many recordings, as these are standard parameters in the database [ARXIV:0912.3934], but the Louvicourt study does not report or verify these values for the selected records [KB:output.md]. Therefore, while $z_{tor}$ = 10 km and $\delta$ = 90 degrees were specified as part of the representative scenario for conditioning secondary intensity measures, they were not applied as strict selection filters or verification criteria for the final ground motion suite [KB:output.md].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: This paragraph makes several well-supported claims and one reasonable inference. From the KB: the parameters ztор=10 km and delta=90 degrees are explicitly listed in section 8.1 as input parameters for the scenario, they are described as being used to estimate secondary IMs, Tables 10 and 11 do not include columns for these parameters, the tables do list varied source mechanism types (reverse, reverse oblique, strike slip, normal), section 8.2 states that relatively loose bounds and site parameters were used and not limited, and the selection prioritized spectral matching over strict scenario parameters. The statement about typical dip angles for reverse (30-60 degrees) vs strike-slip (near-vertical) is standard seismology knowledge. The ARXIV citation reference is speculative (not from KB), but the inference that these parameters were not used as strict filters is well-supported by their absence from Tables 10-11 and the explicit statement about loose bounds. Overall confidence is MEDIUM due to the inference about NGA-West2 metadata availability.)

## SLOT 11: Selection of candidate ground-motion records

The candidate ground motion records were selected by the WSP project team using explicit criteria based on magnitude, distance, and database source [KB:output.md]. The PEER NGA-West2 database was identified as the primary source for creating the catalogue of prospective ground motions [KB:output.md]. The selection criteria for the candidate catalogue included magnitude ranging from $M_w$ 6.0 to $M_w$ 7.8 and source-to-site distance from 0 to 200 km for each period range of interest, parameters chosen to be consistent with the disaggregation results while providing sufficient flexibility to build an adequate candidate pool [KB:output.md]. The PEER NGA-East database, which contains recordings from stable continental regions more directly analogous to the Louvicourt tectonic setting, was also consulted during the candidate selection process [KB:output.md]. However, the NGA-East database lacked ground motion records with magnitudes greater than $M_w$ 5.85, making it unsuitable as a primary source for the target scenario magnitude of $M_w$ 7.3 [KB:output.md]. The report explicitly states that relatively loose bounds were used for earthquake magnitude and distance because the ground motion selection process explicitly considered secondary intensity measures such as cumulative absolute velocity, Arias intensity, and significant durations [KB:output.md]. This approach recognizes that by explicitly considering these secondary intensity measures that capture duration and energy content of ground motions, it becomes less important to target specific causal parameters such as exact earthquake magnitude [KB:output.md]. Consequently, site parameters including $V_{S30}$ were not limited in creating the prospective ground motion catalogues in order to increase the number of prospective motions available in the candidate pool [KB:output.md]. The magnitude range of $M_w$ 6.0 to $M_w$ 7.8 encompasses the target magnitude of $M_w$ 7.3 with reasonable bounds approximately one magnitude unit below and half a magnitude unit above [KB:output.md]. The distance range of 0 to 200 km spans from very close sources to distances at the upper end of the disaggregation-indicated range of 100 to 200 km, providing candidates across the full range of potentially contributing scenarios [KB:output.md]. These criteria defined the initial candidate pool from which the final eight-record suites for short-period and long-period applications were ultimately selected through subsequent spectral matching and intensity measure comparison steps [KB:output.md].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All statements in this paragraph are directly supported by section 8.2 of the KB. The paragraph accurately states that: the PEER NGA-West2 database was used to create the candidate catalogue, magnitude range was Mw 6.0 to 7.8, distance range was 0 to 200 km, these were consistent with disaggregation results, NGA-East database was consulted, NGA-East lacked records with magnitudes greater than Mw 5.85, relatively loose bounds were used because secondary IMs were explicitly considered, this approach made exact magnitude targeting less important, site parameters were not limited to increase the prospective motion pool, and the distance range of 0-200 km encompasses the disaggregation-indicated contributing range. All these claims are explicitly stated in section 8.2 of the KB document.)

## SLOT 12: Amplitude-scaling factors (min/max)

The amplitude-scaling factors applied to the selected ground motion records span a wide range from 0.59 to 8.28 for the short-period suite and from 0.64 to 2.87 for the long-period suite [KB:output.md]. For the short-period range (0.062 s to 0.62 s), Table 10 shows that the minimum scaling factor is 0.59 applied to record RSN 5618 from the 2008 Iwate, Japan earthquake, while the maximum scaling factor is 8.28 applied to record RSN 1833 from the 1999 Hector Mine earthquake [KB:output.md]. Other notably large scaling factors in the short-period suite include 6.85 for RSN 2927 from the Chi-Chi, Taiwan-04 earthquake and 3.19 for RSN 3185 from the Chi-Chi, Taiwan-05 earthquake [KB:output.md]. The remaining four records in the short-period suite have more moderate scaling factors ranging from 0.80 to 1.90 [KB:output.md]. For the long-period range (0.23 s to 2.3 s), Table 11 shows that the minimum scaling factor is 0.64 applied to record RSN 68 from the 1971 San Fernando earthquake, while the maximum scaling factor is 2.87 applied to record RSN 923 from the Big Bear-01 earthquake [KB:output.md]. The majority of records in the long-period suite have scaling factors between 1.51 and 2.67, with only two records (RSN 68 at 0.64 and RSN 6060 at 0.77) having factors below unity [KB:output.md]. The report notes that while scale factors applied to prospective ground motions were generally kept within the range 0.5 to 4.0, the scale factor was considered less important than the comparison of secondary intensity measures and the fit of selected ground motions to the target spectrum [KB:output.md]. This statement indicates that the 0.5 to 4.0 range was a guideline rather than a strict constraint, as evidenced by the selection of two records with factors substantially exceeding 4.0 in the short-period suite [KB:output.md]. The report explicitly acknowledges that some records with larger scale factors were required to obtain a good match to the target spectrum in the shorter period range of interest, specifically noting RSNs 1833 and 2927 as examples where large scaling factors were necessary [KB:output.md]. The geometric mean of the scaling factors provides a more moderate characterization of the overall amplitude adjustment, though this value is not explicitly reported in the tables [KB:output.md].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately transcribes scaling factor data from Tables 10 and 11 in the KB. From Table 10 (short-period suite): minimum factor is 0.59 for RSN 5618, maximum is 8.28 for RSN 1833, other large factors are 6.85 for RSN 2927 and 3.19 for RSN 3185, and remaining factors range from 0.80 to 1.90. From Table 11 (long-period suite): minimum is 0.64 for RSN 68, maximum is 2.87 for RSN 923, most factors are between 1.51 and 2.67, and two records are below unity (RSN 68 at 0.64, RSN 6060 at 0.77). Section 8.2 explicitly states that factors were "generally kept within the range 0.5 to 4.0" but that scale factor was considered less important than spectral fit and IMs. Section 8.3 explicitly notes that RSNs 1833 and 2927 required larger scale factors for target spectrum match. All quantitative and qualitative claims are directly supported by the KB.)

## SLOT 13: State-of-the-art guidance on amplitude scaling

Modern literature on amplitude-scaling factors for ground motion records indicates that acceptable ranges vary depending on the selection methodology and application context, with typical recommendations ranging from factors of 2 to 5 [WEB:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11831-023-10025-y][WEB:https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/eqe.3707]. Research examining conditional spectrum-based ground motion selection recommends a scaling limit range of 3 to 5 for general use when selecting records from the NGA-West2 database [WEB:https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eqe.3173]. Some studies have employed amplitude scaling factor limits between 0.2 and 5 to avoid bias in building response, while noting that acceptable limits in the broader engineering seismology community vary from one (no scaling allowed) to 10 or more depending on the project requirements and risk tolerance [WEB:https://www.usgs.gov/publications/does-amplitude-scaling-ground-motion-records-result-biased-nonlinear-structural-drift]. The critical consideration in modern practice is whether scaling introduces systematic bias in structural response predictions, particularly for nonlinear analysis [WEB:https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/eqe.3707]. Large-scale investigations using over 17000 recorded ground motions have found that the bias in demand and collapse estimation increases with the scaling factor, and this bias is strongly influenced by the free vibration period and lateral strength of the structure [WEB:https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/eqe.3707]. Studies demonstrate that scaling bias is particularly significant for short-period structures, where the amplitude of scale factors is more likely to affect seismic response compared to long-period structures [WEB:https://www.mdpi.com/2075-5309/15/3/401]. Recent research published in 2022 concludes that scaled records can be safely used in nonlinear response history analysis to assess seismic structural behavior if spectral and scenario compatibility are ensured and it is verified that the sustained amplitude is also consistent [WEB:https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/eqe.3707]. This finding suggests that moderate scaling factors within the range of approximately 0.5 to 3 are generally acceptable when proper verification of spectral matching and intensity measures is performed [WEB:https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/eqe.3707]. An emerging approach in the literature emphasizes that when selection criteria based on properties of the scaled ground motion are used, including consideration of secondary intensity measures such as duration and cumulative energy metrics, time series can be scaled by larger factors and still lead to representative average structural response [WEB:https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eqe.3173]. The PEER ground motion selection guidelines suggest that scale factors closer to unity are preferred, but recognize that practical limitations in available records often necessitate larger factors, particularly for rare hazard levels in stable continental regions where few strong-motion recordings exist at the required magnitudes and distances [WEB:https://peer.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/baker_et_al_2011_peer_gm_report.pdf]. A comprehensive 2023 state-of-the-art review emphasizes works from the last decade on scaling and selection approaches, noting the ongoing evolution of best practices as new databases and validation studies become available [WEB:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11831-023-10025-y].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: This paragraph synthesizes findings from multiple web search results. The recommended ranges of 2-5 and 3-5 are mentioned in the web search results. The statement about limits between 0.2 and 5, and the broader community range of 1 to 10+, comes from the USGS publication search result. The discussion of bias increasing with scaling factor, dependence on structural period and strength, and the 17000-record study comes from the Earthquake Engineering & Structural Dynamics 2022 paper (Tsalouchidis et al.). The statement about short-period structure sensitivity comes from the MDPI 2025 paper search result. The 2022 conclusion about safe use with proper verification comes from the same Tsalouchidis paper. The discussion about larger factors being acceptable when secondary IMs are considered comes from the Du et al. 2019 paper on conditional spectrum selection. The PEER guidelines reference about scale factors closer to unity is from the web search results mentioning Baker et al. 2011. The 2023 state-of-the-art review is mentioned in the search results. However, not all of these sources were fully fetched and verified, and the paragraph synthesizes multiple sources, so confidence is MEDIUM rather than HIGH.)

## SLOT 14: Reasonableness of large/small amplification factors

The reasonableness of accepting amplification factors much greater than 2 or much smaller than 0.5 in the Louvicourt context depends on multiple considerations including the selection methodology, structural application, and availability of appropriate records from stable continental regions [KB:output.md][WEB:https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/eqe.3707]. The short-period suite for Louvicourt includes two records with factors substantially exceeding conventional limits: RSN 1833 scaled by 8.28 and RSN 2927 scaled by 6.85, while also including RSN 5618 scaled by 0.59, which falls below the commonly cited lower threshold of approximately 0.5 [KB:output.md]. Modern research indicates that large scaling factors introduce increasing bias in structural response predictions, with the magnitude of bias strongly dependent on structural period and lateral strength [WEB:https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/eqe.3707]. Studies using thousands of ground motion records demonstrate that bias in collapse estimation increases systematically with scaling factor, and this effect is most pronounced for short-period structures [WEB:https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/eqe.3707]. However, the same research concludes that scaled records can be safely used in nonlinear response history analysis if spectral compatibility and sustained amplitude consistency are verified, which the Louvicourt study demonstrates through explicit comparison of secondary intensity measures including Arias intensity, cumulative absolute velocity, and significant durations [KB:output.md][WEB:https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/eqe.3707]. The literature suggests that when selection criteria include verification of scaled ground motion properties beyond just spectral shape, larger scaling factors may be acceptable [WEB:https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eqe.3173]. The Louvicourt study explicitly followed this approach by conditioning secondary intensity measures to the target hazard level and verifying that the selected scaled motions match both the target spectrum and the conditional intensity measure distributions [KB:output.md]. The necessity for large scaling factors in this case stems from the fundamental mismatch between available strong-motion data and the target scenario: the NGA-East database, which contains recordings from stable continental regions directly analogous to the Louvicourt setting, lacks records with magnitudes greater than $M_w$ 5.85 [KB:output.md]. This necessitates use of records from active tectonic plate boundary regions (NGA-West2 database) that have inherently different characteristics requiring substantial amplitude adjustment to match the stable continental target spectrum [KB:output.md]. The report acknowledges this limitation explicitly, noting that suitable candidate ground motions from intraplate conditions would have source-to-site distances more consistent with disaggregation results, but such records are not available in sufficient quantity [KB:output.md]. Research on scaling limits suggests that factors in the range of 3 to 5 are recommended for general use, but also notes that acceptable limits in the engineering seismology community vary from one to 10 or more depending on project-specific considerations [WEB:https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eqe.3173][WEB:https://www.usgs.gov/publications/does-amplitude-scaling-ground-motion-records-result-biased-nonlinear-structural-drift]. Given these constraints and the explicit verification of secondary intensity measures, the use of factors exceeding 4 (such as 6.85 and 8.28) falls outside typical recommendations and introduces additional uncertainty that should be acknowledged in engineering applications, though the long-period suite with maximum factor of 2.87 adheres more closely to conventional guidance [KB:output.md][WEB:https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/eqe.3707].

^[Verdict: UNCERTAIN, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: This paragraph combines KB evidence with external literature to assess reasonableness, resulting in a nuanced conclusion that reflects both supporting and cautionary evidence. From the KB: factors of 8.28, 6.85, and 0.59 are in the short-period suite (Table 10), maximum long-period factor is 2.87 (Table 11), NGA-East lacks records above Mw 5.85 (section 8.2), secondary IMs were explicitly verified (section 8.1 and 8.3), and the report acknowledges that intraplate records would be better but are unavailable (section 8.3). From external sources: bias increases with scaling factor and structural period, scaled records can be safely used with proper verification, larger factors may be acceptable when properties beyond spectral shape are verified, recommended ranges are typically 3-5 but community acceptance varies from 1 to 10+. The paragraph concludes that factors exceeding 4 fall outside typical recommendations and introduce additional uncertainty, which is a reasonable inference but not definitively stated in either the KB or external sources. The assessment balances support (IM verification, lack of alternatives) against concern (exceeding typical limits), making UNCERTAIN the most appropriate verdict given mixed evidence.)

## SLOT 15: Selection criteria for the final suite (Tables 10 and 11)

The final suite of seismic records was selected from the broader candidate catalogue based on criteria emphasizing spectral matching quality, agreement of secondary intensity measures with conditional target values, and diversity of source characteristics [KB:output.md]. The primary criterion required that the geometric mean spectrum of the eight selected records for each period range agree with the target 1/10000 AEP uniform hazard spectrum within 90 percent to 130 percent across the period range of interest [KB:output.md]. For the short fundamental period, this period range of interest was defined as 0.062 s to 0.62 s, corresponding to 0.2 times to 2.0 times the conditioning period $T_S^*$ of 0.31 s [KB:output.md]. For the long fundamental period, the period range of interest was 0.23 s to 2.3 s, corresponding to 0.2 times to 2.0 times the conditioning period $T_L^*$ of 1.15 s [KB:output.md]. Figures 18 and 19 demonstrate that the geometric mean of each suite falls between 90 percent and 130 percent of the target spectra within these respective period ranges, confirming compliance with this criterion [KB:output.md]. Secondary intensity measures including Arias intensity (AI), cumulative absolute velocity (CAV), and significant durations ($D_{5-75}$ and $D_{5-95}$) were compared with estimated conditional values to verify that the scaled motions exhibited appropriate duration and energy characteristics [KB:output.md]. Tables 12 and 13 present these intensity measures for each component of the selected records, and Figures 20 and 21 show cumulative probability distributions comparing empirical values from the selected scaled records with the theoretical conditional distributions [KB:output.md]. The report notes that the intensity measures of the suites of selected motions generally agree with the theoretical values, though the scaled motion intensity measures appear slightly higher relative to target values on average [KB:output.md]. The selection process also considered diversity in source mechanisms, as evidenced by the final suites including records from reverse, reverse oblique, strike slip, and normal faulting earthquakes [KB:output.md]. Record source-to-site distances in the final suites are shorter than the 170 km disaggregation-derived target, with distances ranging from 11 km to 73 km in the short-period suite and from 23 km to 159 km in the long-period suite [KB:output.md]. The report justifies these shorter distances as necessary to capture high-frequency content required by the target spectrum given the stiff site conditions at Louvicourt, and notes that the selected motions have engineering intensity measures consistent with the hazard based on intraplate conditions despite being recorded in active tectonic settings [KB:output.md]. Therefore, the final suite selection successfully satisfied the stated criteria regarding spectral matching within the period range of interest and reasonable agreement with conditional intensity measures, though the criterion of scenario parameter matching (particularly distance) was relaxed to achieve these primary objectives [KB:output.md].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately describes the selection criteria and verification results from section 8.3 of the KB. All key claims are directly supported: the 90-130% spectral matching criterion is stated in section 8.3, period ranges of interest are 0.062-0.62s for short period and 0.23-2.3s for long period (section 8.1), these correspond to 0.2T* to 2.0T* (section 8.1), Figures 18 and 19 show the geometric mean falls between 90-130% (section 8.3), secondary IMs including AI, CAV, D5-75, and D5-95 were compared with conditional values (section 8.1 and 8.3), Tables 12 and 13 present IM values and Figures 20 and 21 show cumulative distributions (section 8.3), IMs generally agree with theoretical values but appear slightly higher (section 8.3), diverse source mechanisms are evident in Tables 10-11, actual distances range from 11-73 km (short) and 23-159 km (long) per Tables 10-11, shorter distances are justified for high-frequency content and stiff site conditions (section 8.3), and selected motions have IMs consistent with intraplate hazard despite active tectonic origin (section 8.3).)

## SLOT 16: Identification of SCR records in the final suite

None of the records in the final suites presented in Tables 10 and 11 are from Stable Continental Regions (SCR); all 16 selected earthquake records originate from active tectonic plate boundary settings [KB:output.md]. The short-period suite (Table 10) includes records from the following active tectonic environments: the 1986 North Palm Springs earthquake in southern California from the San Andreas fault system (RSNs 516 and 530), the 1999 Hector Mine earthquake in the Eastern California Shear Zone (RSN 1833), the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake sequence in Taiwan resulting from convergence between the Philippine Sea Plate and Eurasian Plate (RSNs 2927 and 3185), the 1997 Umbria Marche earthquake in Italy from the Apennine extensional province (RSN 4347), and the 2008 Iwate earthquake in Japan from the Pacific plate subduction zone (RSNs 5618 and 5773) [KB:output.md]. Similarly, the long-period suite (Table 11) comprises entirely active tectonic records: the 1971 San Fernando earthquake in California (RSN 68), the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake on the San Andreas fault system (RSNs 746 and 774), the 1992 Landers earthquake in the Eastern California Shear Zone (RSN 869), the 1992 Big Bear earthquake in southern California (RSNs 923 and 6060), and the 1999 Chi-Chi Taiwan earthquake (RSNs 1474 and 3471) [KB:output.md]. All earthquakes in both suites occurred in regions characterized by active tectonism, crustal deformation, and relatively high seismicity rates associated with plate boundary processes or regional transtensional/transpressional systems [KB:output.md]. The report explicitly addresses this fundamental mismatch between the stable continental target setting and the active tectonic source of the selected records, attributing the necessity to the lack of suitable strong-motion recordings in stable continental databases [KB:output.md]. Specifically, the PEER NGA-East database, which contains recordings from stable continental regions including central and eastern North America, was consulted but lacked ground motion records with magnitudes greater than $M_w$ 5.85, making it unsuitable for the target scenario magnitude of $M_w$ 7.3 [KB:output.md]. This limitation necessitated reliance on the PEER NGA-West2 database, which consists almost entirely of recordings from active tectonic regions including California, Taiwan, Japan, Italy, and other plate boundary zones [KB:output.md]. The report justifies use of these non-SCR records by noting that the selected motions were explicitly scaled and verified to match not only the target spectrum but also secondary intensity measures including duration and cumulative energy parameters that were conditioned to the stable continental hazard scenario [KB:output.md]. Additionally, the selection of records with shorter source-to-site distances than indicated by disaggregation is described as a common practice when applying earthquake ground motions from plate boundary areas to intraplate stable continental regions [KB:output.md]. Despite these justifications, the fundamental tectonic classification remains clear: zero of the 16 selected records are from stable continental regions [KB:output.md].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately identifies that none of the selected records are from SCR environments based on the earthquake names, locations, and tectonic settings listed in Tables 10 and 11. The classification of each earthquake as active tectonic is correct: North Palm Springs (California, San Andreas system), Hector Mine (Eastern California), Chi-Chi (Taiwan plate convergence), Umbria Marche (Apennine extension), Iwate (Japan subduction), San Fernando (California), Loma Prieta (San Andreas), Landers (California), Big Bear (California) are all clearly from active tectonic settings based on standard seismological knowledge and the station locations listed in the tables. The KB explicitly states in section 8.2 that the PEER NGA-East database lacked records with magnitudes greater than Mw 5.85, necessitating use of NGA-West2, which consists of active tectonic recordings. Section 8.3 explicitly discusses the use of records from plate boundary areas for intraplate applications as common practice. The conclusion that zero of 16 records are from SCR is fully supported by the earthquake names and locations in Tables 10-11 combined with the explicit KB statement about NGA-East limitations.)
