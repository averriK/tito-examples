# Louvicourt PSHA Technical Review

## SLOT 1: Tectonic regimes within 1000 km

The Louvicourt tailings storage facility site in southwestern Quebec is situated within the Canadian Shield physiographic province, which is part of the North American Craton [KB:output.md]. The Canadian Shield formed from the collision of Archean-age microcontinents during the Paleoproterozoic (2.5 to 1.6 Ga), with the microcontinents combining to form the ancient continent of Laurentia [KB:output.md]. This region is characterized as a stable continental region (SCR), specifically within the Central and Eastern North America (CENA) tectonic domain [KB:output.md]. The site is located within the Abitibi Sub-province of the Superior Province, near the boundary with the Pontiac Sub-province, marked by the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone [KB:output.md]. The tectonic regime controlling seismicity within the 1000 km radius is that of a cratonic interior, where seismicity is infrequent, diffuse, and generally not associated with mapped geological structures [KB:output.md] [WEB:https://www.usgs.gov/data/scr_catalog.php]. The Canadian Shield represents one of the oldest known cratons containing rocks dating back several billion years [KB:output.md]. This stable continental regime influences the PSHA by producing relatively low seismicity rates, large epicentral distances for controlling earthquakes, and ground motion attenuation characteristics distinct from those in active tectonic regions [KB:output.md]. The seismic source model implemented for this PSHA is the sixth-generation seismic hazard model of Canada (CanadaSHM6), which was specifically developed for southeastern Canada by the Geological Survey of Canada [KB:output.md]. The CanadaSHM6 incorporates areal seismic sources that represent the diffuse seismicity characteristic of stable continental regions rather than discrete fault sources [KB:output.md].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately describes the tectonic regimes controlling seismicity within 1000 km of the Louvicourt site based on direct statements from the KB document. The KB explicitly states the site is within the Canadian Shield (a craton), part of the Superior Province Abitibi Sub-province, and uses CanadaSHM6 seismic source models. The characterization as a stable continental region (SCR) within CENA is directly stated in the KB. The description of cratonic seismicity as diffuse and not associated with mapped structures is supported by specific KB statements about the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone being seismically inactive. The reference to CanadaSHM6 and its development for southeastern Canada is directly cited in the KB. The external web citation provides supporting context about SCR earthquake catalogs. All factual claims are well-supported by the cited sources.]

## SLOT 2: Source type classification (SCC)

The seismic sources in the site-specific source model are classified as stable continental crust (SCC) or stable continental region (SCR) type [KB:output.md]. The PSHA report states that the 17 NGA-East ground motion models (GMMs) were selected specifically because they were developed for stable continental regions in central and eastern North America, indicating that all seismic sources are treated as SCR type [KB:output.md]. The report explicitly notes that the NGA-East median ground motions are suitable for the assessment because the Louvicourt TSF site is surrounded by a stable continental region tectonic setting [KB:output.md]. The CanadaSHM6 seismic source model adopted for this study consists of areal sources representing the diffuse seismicity characteristic of stable continental regions rather than active fault sources [KB:output.md]. The report confirms that major fault zones in the region, including the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone, are not included as discrete seismic sources because they are presently seismically and geologically inactive, lacking earthquake epicenter alignments and geomorphic evidence for past surface fault rupture [KB:output.md]. Therefore, all seismic sources included in the site-specific source model are of stable continental crust (SCC) type, with no non-SCC sources identified or included in the model [KB:output.md].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph correctly identifies that all seismic sources in the model are SCR/SCC type based on multiple direct statements in the KB. The KB explicitly states that NGA-East GMMs were selected because they were developed for stable continental regions and are suitable for the Louvicourt site's tectonic setting. The KB confirms that CanadaSHM6 consists of areal sources (not discrete faults) representing diffuse SCR seismicity. The KB explicitly states that the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone and other major faults are not included as discrete sources because they are seismically inactive. The conclusion that all sources are SCC/SCR type with no non-SCC sources is a valid inference from the KB's statements about regional tectonics, GMM selection rationale, and source model composition. All citations reference the KB document appropriately.]

## SLOT 3: Controlling events for frequent hazard levels

For annual exceedance probabilities (AEP) between 1/475 and 1/1000 years, the hazard deaggregation results identify the controlling earthquake scenarios [KB:output.md]. The PSHA report provides Table 6, which summarizes the average distance, magnitude, and epsilon from magnitude-distance disaggregation of hazard from all sources [KB:output.md]. For the 1/2,475 AEP (close to the 1/475 to 1/1000 range), the modal magnitude values range from $M_w$ 6.8 to $M_w$ 7.4 across different spectral periods [KB:output.md]. The modal epicentral distances for these frequent hazard levels range from approximately 90 km to 180 km [KB:output.md]. At peak ground acceleration (PGA), the mean magnitude is approximately $M_w$ 7.1 with a mean distance of about 150 km [KB:output.md]. At a spectral period of 0.2 seconds, similar magnitudes and distances control the hazard [KB:output.md]. At longer periods (0.5 s and 1.0 s), the controlling magnitudes shift slightly toward $M_w$ 7.2 to $M_w$ 7.4, with distances remaining in the 140 km to 170 km range [KB:output.md]. The disaggregation figures show that the largest contribution to seismic hazard at these frequent return periods comes from moderate- to large-magnitude earthquakes ($M_w$ 6.8 to $M_w$ 7.5) at source-to-site distances of about 100 to 200 km [KB:output.md]. There are also smaller contributions from moderate-magnitude earthquakes (typically $M_w$ less than 6.0) within about 40 km of the site, particularly at short spectral periods [KB:output.md].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately reports controlling earthquake parameters for frequent hazard levels based on Table 6 and disaggregation results explicitly described in the KB. The KB provides Table 6 with "Average Distance, Magnitude, and Epsilon from Magnitude-Distance Disaggregation" for various AEPs including 1/2,475. The KB states that disaggregation plots for 1/2,475 AEP are presented in Figure 15. The magnitude ranges ($M_w$ 6.8-7.5) and distance ranges (100-200 km) are directly quoted from KB text describing the disaggregation results. The statement about smaller contributions from moderate earthquakes ($M_w$ less than 6.0) within 40 km at short periods is directly cited from the KB's conclusions section. The use of 1/2,475 AEP as representative of the "frequent" range (1/475 to 1/1000) is reasonable given that the task asked for the 1/475 to 1/1000 range and 1/2,475 is the closest available data point in the PSHA report. All quantitative claims are traceable to specific KB statements.]

## SLOT 4: Controlling events for rare hazard levels

For rare annual exceedance probabilities between 1/5,000 and 1/10,000 years, the controlling earthquake scenarios are characterized by similar magnitude ranges but with some differences in the distance distribution compared to more frequent events [KB:output.md]. Table 6 provides disaggregation results for both the 1/5,000 and 1/10,000 AEPs [KB:output.md]. For the 1/5,000 AEP, modal magnitude values range from $M_w$ 7.0 to $M_w$ 7.4 across different spectral periods, with modal distances in the range of 90 km to 170 km [KB:output.md]. For the 1/10,000 AEP, which represents the rarest hazard level analyzed, modal magnitudes range from $M_w$ 7.2 to $M_w$ 7.5, with modal distances ranging from approximately 90 km to 170 km [KB:output.md]. Figure 17 presents the magnitude-distance-epsilon disaggregation for the 1/10,000 AEP and shows that the largest contribution comes from earthquakes with magnitudes of about $M_w$ 6.8 to $M_w$ 7.5 and source-to-site distances of about 100 to 200 km, for both shorter spectral periods (e.g., 0.2 s) and longer spectral periods (e.g., 1.0 s) [KB:output.md]. The mean, median, and mode values for magnitude and distance generally agree at both shorter and longer spectral periods [KB:output.md]. At these rare return periods, there are smaller contributions from moderate- to large-magnitude earthquakes ($M_w$ 6.8 to $M_w$ 7.4) at greater source-to-site distances of about 360 km and greater [KB:output.md]. The controlling scenarios for rare hazard levels are characterized by slightly higher magnitudes and similar or slightly shorter distances compared to the more frequent hazard levels [KB:output.md].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately reports the controlling earthquake parameters for rare hazard levels (1/5,000 and 1/10,000 AEP) based on Table 6 and Figure 17 explicitly described in the KB. The KB provides disaggregation data for both 1/5,000 and 1/10,000 AEPs in Table 6. The magnitude ranges ($M_w$ 7.0-7.5 for 1/5,000; $M_w$ 7.2-7.5 for 1/10,000) and distance ranges (90-170 km) are consistent with KB descriptions of disaggregation results. The KB explicitly states that Figure 17 shows disaggregation for 1/10,000 AEP with contributions from $M_w$ 6.8-7.5 at 100-200 km distances. The statement about mean, median, and mode values agreeing is directly quoted from KB text. The mention of smaller contributions from earthquakes at distances "about 360 km and greater" is directly cited from the KB's conclusions section. The comparison with frequent hazard levels (similar distances, slightly higher magnitudes) is a valid inference from the Table 6 data presented in the KB. All claims are well-supported by cited KB content.]

## SLOT 5: Active neotectonic faults within 100 km

Within 100 km of the Louvicourt site, there are no identified active neotectonic faults included in the seismic source model [KB:output.md]. The PSHA report explicitly states that the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone, a major structural complex located approximately 10 km from the site, is not included as a discrete seismic source [KB:output.md]. The report provides several lines of evidence for this exclusion: the nature of the fault zone rocks, their present-day tectonic setting within the Canadian Shield, a lack of earthquake epicenter alignments along the fault, and no geomorphic evidence for past surface fault rupture [KB:output.md]. The report notes that while three earthquake epicenters near the site are located within the wider Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone, earthquakes are absent in other parts of the fault zone, indicating that the fault is presently seismically and geologically inactive [KB:output.md]. Similarly, other major fault zones within the wider region are not included as discrete seismic sources for the same reasons [KB:output.md]. The seismic source model defines known active and potentially active seismic sources as faults where there is evidence of surface displacement during the Upper Pleistocene stage of the Pleistocene Epoch (i.e., about the last 126,000 years) [KB:output.md]. No faults meeting this criterion within 100 km of the site are identified in the PSHA report [KB:output.md]. Instead, the seismic hazard is modeled using areal sources from the CanadaSHM6 model that represent the diffuse, background seismicity characteristic of stable continental regions [KB:output.md].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph correctly concludes that no active neotectonic faults within 100 km are included in the seismic source model, based on explicit statements in the KB. The KB directly states that the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone (located approximately 10 km from the site) is not included as a discrete seismic source. The KB provides detailed evidence for this exclusion: nature of fault zone rocks, tectonic setting, lack of epicenter alignments, and no geomorphic evidence for surface fault rupture. The KB explicitly states these faults "are at present seismically and geologically inactive" and "are not included as discrete seismic sources." The KB defines criteria for active faults as those with "evidence of surface displacement during the Upper Pleistocene stage" (last 126,000 years) and notes that the assessment considers faults meeting this criterion. The KB confirms the use of CanadaSHM6 areal sources rather than discrete fault sources. The conclusion that no active neotectonic faults within 100 km are identified is directly supported by KB statements and the absence of any mention of discrete fault sources in the model description. All citations are appropriate.]

## SLOT 6: Consideration of Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE)

The PSHA report does not explicitly define or calculate a Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE) for specific sources in the manner typically used in deterministic seismic hazard assessments [KB:output.md]. Instead, the report implements maximum earthquake magnitudes ($M_{max}$) as part of the probabilistic seismic source characterization [KB:output.md]. The report states that maximum earthquake magnitudes are estimated based on observed earthquakes, historical estimates, and instrumentally recorded earthquakes, and/or empirical relationships between fault parameters and earthquake magnitude [KB:output.md]. In the CanadaSHM6 seismic source model adopted for this study, the logic tree includes three alternative $M_{max}$ branches that are collapsed into a single magnitude-frequency distribution (MFD) branch for computational efficiency [KB:output.md]. The report notes that while collapsing these branches had a negligible impact on median hazard values, it limits the ability to perform detailed analysis of the fractiles or model input sensitivity tests [KB:output.md]. The $M_{max}$ values are incorporated as epistemic uncertainty parameters in the PSHA logic tree rather than as deterministic MCE scenarios [KB:output.md]. The report does not specify the actual $M_{max}$ values assigned to individual seismic sources within the CanadaSHM6 model, as these parameters are adopted without modification from the published CanadaSHM6 source model [KB:output.md]. Therefore, while maximum magnitude constraints are used in the probabilistic hazard analysis, an explicitly defined and calculated MCE in the deterministic sense is not presented for any specific source in the PSHA [KB:output.md].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph correctly identifies that no explicit MCE in the deterministic sense is defined or calculated, while accurately describing the $M_{max}$ implementation in the probabilistic framework. The KB explicitly discusses maximum earthquake magnitudes ($M_{max}$) and states they are "estimated based on observed earthquakes, historical estimates, and instrumentally recorded earthquakes, and/or empirical relationships between fault parameters." The KB describes the CanadaSHM6 logic tree with "three alternative $M_{max}$ branches" that were "collapsed into a single MFD branch for computational efficiency," directly quoted in this paragraph. The KB states that collapsing these branches "had a negligible impact on median hazard values" but "limits the ability to perform a detailed analysis of the fractiles or model input sensitivity tests." The KB confirms that CanadaSHM6 parameters are "implemented without modification" and does not provide specific $M_{max}$ values for individual sources. The distinction between probabilistic $M_{max}$ treatment and deterministic MCE is appropriate given the PSHA framework described in the KB. The KB makes no mention of MCE in the deterministic sense, supporting the conclusion. All statements are well-supported by KB citations.]

## SLOT 7: Executive summary of ground-motion record selection

The ground-motion record selection process described in chapter 8.0 of the PSHA report follows a systematic approach to develop earthquake acceleration time histories (EATHs) compatible with the site conditions and PSHA results [KB:output.md]. The selection was performed to support advanced geotechnical stability analyses of the Louvicourt TSF, with ground motions amplitude-scaled to represent the mean uniform hazard spectrum (UHS) for the 1/10,000 AEP at the site seismic ground condition of $V_{S30}$ equals 1,853 m/s [KB:output.md]. Two suites of eight, two-horizontal-component EATHs were developed for two different fundamental periods: a shorter period ($T_S$) in the range 0.25 s to 0.37 s, and a longer period ($T_L$) of approximately 1.15 s [KB:output.md]. The main selection steps were as follows. First, the 1/10,000 AEP hazard disaggregation results were reviewed, and a representative set of causal parameters (earthquake magnitude and rupture distance) was selected [KB:output.md]. Second, target secondary intensity measures (IMs) consistent with the 1/10,000 AEP hazard were estimated using an earthquake scenario based on the causal parameters from disaggregation, with magnitude $M_w$ equals 7.3 and rupture distance $r_{rup}$ equals 170 km [KB:output.md]. Third, a catalogue of candidate ground motion records with generally similar causal parameters was developed from the PEER NGA-West2 and NGA-East databases [KB:output.md]. Fourth, candidate ground motions were amplitude-scaled to be in general agreement with the target spectrum, with a focus on the fit of the horizontal geometric mean response with the target spectrum across the period ranges of interest [KB:output.md]. Fifth, the secondary IMs of each selected, scaled horizontal ground motion record were compared with the estimated conditional IM values [KB:output.md]. Sixth, the selected suite of ground motions was accepted once the geometric mean of the horizontal components agreed with the target spectrum within the period range of interest and the empirical IMs compared reasonably well with the conditional IM values [KB:output.md].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately summarizes the six-step ground-motion record selection process described in chapter 8.0 of the KB document. Each step is directly quoted or closely paraphrased from the KB. The KB explicitly lists these selection steps as a numbered sequence. The target spectrum (1/10,000 AEP mean UHS), site condition ($V_{S30}$ equals 1,853 m/s), and fundamental periods ($T_S$ 0.25-0.37 s, $T_L$ approximately 1.15 s) are all directly stated in the KB. The causal parameters ($M_w$ 7.3, $r_{rup}$ 170 km) are explicitly stated in the KB. The databases used (PEER NGA-West2 and NGA-East) are explicitly mentioned in the KB. The criteria for amplitude scaling and secondary intensity measures are described in detail in the KB and accurately reflected here. The acceptance criteria (geometric mean agreement with target spectrum and reasonable comparison of empirical IMs with conditional values) are directly stated in the KB. This is a faithful and accurate executive summary of the selection methodology described in chapter 8.0 of the PSHA report. All citations reference the KB appropriately.]

## SLOT 8: Adequacy of basic selection criteria (M 7.3, Rrup 170 km, etc.)

The selection criteria of magnitude $M_w$ 7.3 and rupture distance $r_{rup}$ approximately 170 km are generally appropriate for the tectonic setting, though some considerations warrant attention [KB:output.md]. The report justifies these parameters based on the disaggregation results, which show that the largest contribution to the 1/10,000 AEP seismic hazard comes from earthquakes with magnitudes of about $M_w$ 6.8 to $M_w$ 7.5 and source-to-site distances of about 100 to 200 km [KB:output.md]. The selection of $M_w$ 7.3 represents the modal value from the disaggregation analysis [KB:output.md]. However, a notable feature of the implementation is that the actual ground motion records in the final suites (Tables 10 and 11) include records with shorter source-to-site distances than suggested by the disaggregation results [KB:output.md]. The report acknowledges this and explains that the shorter source-to-site distances allowed a better fit to the target spectrum while still agreeing with estimated conditional intensity measures [KB:output.md]. The report notes that the selection of records with shorter source-to-site distances is commonly used when applying earthquake ground motions from plate boundary areas to intraplate stable continental regions such as southeastern Canada [KB:output.md]. A major reason for this adjustment is the difference between the Louvicourt TSF site condition ($V_{S30}$ equals 1,853 m/s) and the relatively less stiff plate boundary ground conditions where the prospective ground motions were recorded [KB:output.md]. The report states that moderate- to high-frequency ground motions are attenuated faster by weaker seismic ground conditions compared to stiffer conditions, necessitating the use of records with shorter distances to capture the high-frequency ground motions indicated by the target spectrum [KB:output.md]. Research on stable continental regions confirms that ground motion attenuation characteristics differ significantly between SCRs and active tectonic regions, with less attenuation in eastern North America compared to other SCRs [WEB:https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2002GL015457]. The final suites include records from active tectonic regions (NGA-West2 database) because the NGA-East database lacked ground motions with magnitudes greater than $M_w$ 5.85 [KB:output.md]. This limitation means that no directly analogous SCR records at the required magnitude were available, a recognized constraint in stable continental region hazard assessments [WEB:https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/87552930211015695].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: This paragraph provides a nuanced assessment of the selection criteria adequacy based on explicit KB statements and external SCR literature. The KB directly states that disaggregation shows contributions from $M_w$ 6.8-7.5 at 100-200 km distances, justifying the $M_w$ 7.3 and 170 km criteria. The KB explicitly acknowledges that "selected suites of ground motions for $T_S$ and $T_L$ include records with shorter source-to-site distances than suggested by the magnitude-distance-epsilon disaggregation results" and provides detailed explanation for this choice. The KB states this practice is "commonly used when applying earthquake ground motions from plate boundary areas to intraplate stable continental regions." The KB provides the $V_{S30}$ comparison and attenuation explanation. The KB confirms NGA-East database "lacked ground motions records with magnitudes greater than $M_w$ 5.85." The external citations on SCR attenuation differences and NGA-East database limitations provide appropriate supporting context. The assessment of "generally appropriate...though some considerations warrant attention" is a fair characterization given the acknowledged departures from disaggregation-indicated distances. Confidence is MEDIUM rather than HIGH because the paragraph includes some interpretive assessment of adequacy beyond pure factual reporting, though this interpretation is well-grounded in the cited evidence.]

## SLOT 9: Origin and validity of the 170 km rupture distance

The 170 km rupture distance used as a selection criterion originates directly from the hazard deaggregation analysis performed for the 1/10,000 AEP [KB:output.md]. Table 6 presents the average distance, magnitude, and epsilon from magnitude-distance disaggregation of hazard from all sources, showing modal distances in the range of approximately 90 km to 170 km for the 1/10,000 AEP across different spectral periods [KB:output.md]. Figure 17 presents the magnitude-distance-epsilon disaggregation plots for the 1/10,000 AEP at peak ground acceleration (PGA) and spectral periods of 0.2 s, 0.5 s, and 1.0 s [KB:output.md]. The report states that "ground motions were selected based on the modal disaggregation scenario of $M_w$ 7.3 and 170 km source-to-site distance" [KB:output.md]. This distance is specifically valid for the 1/10,000 AEP hazard level, which is the target return period for the earthquake acceleration time history development [KB:output.md]. The report shows that mean, median, and mode values for the distance generally agree at both shorter and longer spectral periods for this return period [KB:output.md]. The 170 km distance represents a characteristic value within the broader range of 100 to 200 km that dominates the hazard contribution at this rare return period [KB:output.md]. For other return periods (1/2,475 or 1/5,000 AEP), the controlling distances may differ slightly, though Table 6 indicates that similar distance ranges contribute to the hazard across the analyzed return periods [KB:output.md]. The report explicitly ties the 170 km distance to the controlling scenarios identified through the disaggregation analysis for the specific 1/10,000 AEP target hazard level used in the EATH development [KB:output.md].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately identifies the origin of the 170 km rupture distance as the hazard deaggregation analysis for 1/10,000 AEP, based on explicit statements in the KB. The KB provides Table 6 with disaggregation results showing distances in the 90-170 km range for 1/10,000 AEP. The KB explicitly states "ground motions were selected based on the modal disaggregation scenario of $M_w$ 7.3 and 170 km source-to-site distance" (direct quote). The KB confirms Figure 17 presents disaggregation for 1/10,000 AEP at multiple spectral periods. The KB states that "mean, median, and mode values for the magnitude and distance generally agree at the shorter and longer spectral periods" for this AEP. The KB explicitly ties the distance to the 1/10,000 AEP target: "The 1/10,000 AEP hazard disaggregation results...were reviewed, and a representative set of causal parameters...selected." The characterization of 170 km as within the 100-200 km range that dominates hazard contribution is supported by KB statements about disaggregation results. The clarification that this distance is specifically valid for 1/10,000 AEP (and may differ for other return periods) is appropriate given Table 6 shows data for multiple AEPs. All claims are directly traceable to KB content.]

## SLOT 10: Application of "depth-to-top rupture" and "rupture plane dip 90" criteria

The criteria for depth-to-top rupture ($z_{tor}$ equals 10 km) and rupture plane dip ($\delta$ equals 90 degrees) were specified in the earthquake scenario used to estimate target secondary intensity measures, but their application in the actual record selection process requires clarification [KB:output.md]. The report states that target secondary intensity measures were estimated using an earthquake scenario with specific input parameters including depth to top of rupture ($z_{tor}$) equals 10 km and rupture plane dip ($\delta$) equals 90 degrees [KB:output.md]. The report notes that these parameters "were assumed based on our judgement of reasonable values for earthquakes occuring in stable continental regions such as southeastern Canada" [KB:output.md]. However, Tables 10 and 11, which list the selected earthquake acceleration time histories, do not include columns for depth-to-top rupture or rupture plane dip, instead listing only Record Sequence Number, Earthquake Name, Year, Recording Station Name, Source Mechanism Type, Magnitude, Rupture Distance, Site Ground Condition, and Scale Factor [KB:output.md]. The report does not explicitly verify whether the $z_{tor}$ and $\delta$ criteria were used as filters when constructing the candidate catalogue from the PEER NGA-West2 and NGA-East databases [KB:output.md]. The report states that "relatively loose bounds were used for earthquake magnitude and distance" in creating the prospective ground motion catalogues, and that "the site parameters, therefore, were not limited in creating the prospective ground motion catalogues to increase the number of prospective motions in the catalogue" [KB:output.md]. This phrasing suggests that parameters beyond magnitude and distance may not have been strictly constrained during catalogue construction [KB:output.md]. The report emphasizes that "the ground motion selection process explicitly considered secondary IMs" and states that "by explicitly considering the secondary IMs, it is less important to target specific causal parameters such as earthquake magnitude" [KB:output.md]. This approach prioritizes matching target intensity measures over strict adherence to all scenario parameters [KB:output.md]. Without explicit verification from the PEER NGA-West2 metadata for the selected records, it cannot be conclusively determined whether the depth-to-top rupture and rupture plane dip criteria were systematically applied as filters during the final selection [KB:output.md].

^[Verdict: UNCERTAIN, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: This paragraph accurately identifies ambiguity in the KB regarding whether $z_{tor}$ and $\delta$ criteria were actually applied during record selection. The KB explicitly states these parameters ($z_{tor}$ equals 10 km, $\delta$ equals 90 degrees) were used in the earthquake scenario for estimating target secondary IMs and describes them as "assumed based on our judgement of reasonable values for earthquakes occuring in stable continental regions." The KB confirms Tables 10 and 11 do not list $z_{tor}$ or $\delta$ values for the selected records, only listing the parameters explicitly mentioned in this paragraph. The KB states "relatively loose bounds were used for earthquake magnitude and distance" and "the site parameters, therefore, were not limited in creating the prospective ground motion catalogues," suggesting parameters beyond M and R may not have been strictly constrained. The KB emphasizes that the selection process prioritized matching secondary IMs and states "it is less important to target specific causal parameters" when secondary IMs are considered. The paragraph correctly identifies that the KB does not provide explicit verification of whether these criteria were applied as filters. The UNCERTAIN verdict is appropriate because the KB provides the scenario parameters but does not explicitly confirm their application during catalogue construction or final selection, despite describing them in the methodology. Confidence is MEDIUM because the KB evidence is clear but incomplete on this specific question.]

## SLOT 11: Selection of candidate ground-motion records

The candidate ground-motion records for the two suites of earthquake acceleration time histories were selected from the PEER NGA-West2 database, with the PEER NGA-East database also consulted but found to lack suitable records [KB:output.md]. The report states that "the PEER NGA-West2 database was used to create a catalogue of prospective ground motions" with specific selection criteria applied [KB:output.md]. The explicit criteria used to build the candidate catalogue included earthquake magnitude ranging from $M_w$ 6.0 to $M_w$ 7.8 and source-to-site distance from 0 to 200 km [KB:output.md]. These ranges were selected to be consistent with the disaggregation results while being "relatively loose bounds" to "increase the number of prospective motions in the catalogue" [KB:output.md]. The report notes that "the PEER NGA-East database was also consulted but lacked ground motions records with magnitudes greater than $M_w$ 5.85" [KB:output.md]. The selection process explicitly considered secondary intensity measures, and the report states that "by explicitly considering the secondary IMs, it is less important to target specific causal parameters such as earthquake magnitude" [KB:output.md]. The report notes that "the site parameters, therefore, were not limited in creating the prospective ground motion catalogues" beyond the magnitude and distance bounds [KB:output.md]. While the scenario earthquake used for estimating target secondary IMs specified additional parameters including hypocentral depth (20 km), depth to top of rupture (10 km), and rupture plane dip (90 degrees), the report does not explicitly state whether these parameters were used as filters in constructing the candidate catalogue [KB:output.md]. The catalogues were developed separately for each period range of interest (short period 0.062 s to 0.62 s and long period 0.23 s to 2.3 s) [KB:output.md]. The final candidate ground motions were then subjected to amplitude scaling to achieve general agreement with the target spectrum, with scale factors "generally kept within the range 0.5 to 4.0" though "the scale factor was considered less important than the comparison of secondary IMs and the fit of selected ground motions to the target spectrum" [KB:output.md].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately describes the candidate ground-motion record selection process based on explicit statements in the KB. The KB directly states "the PEER NGA-West2 database was used to create a catalogue of prospective ground motions" and that "the PEER NGA-East database was also consulted but lacked ground motions records with magnitudes greater than $M_w$ 5.85." The magnitude range ($M_w$ 6.0 to $M_w$ 7.8) and distance range (0 to 200 km) are explicitly stated in the KB. The KB characterizes these as "relatively loose bounds" used to "increase the number of prospective motions in the catalogue" (direct quotes). The KB explicitly states the selection process "explicitly considered secondary IMs" and that "it is less important to target specific causal parameters" when secondary IMs are used. The KB states "the site parameters, therefore, were not limited in creating the prospective ground motion catalogues." The scenario parameters (hypocentral depth, depth to top of rupture, rupture plane dip) are listed in the KB, and the paragraph correctly notes the KB does not explicitly state whether these were used as catalogue filters. The scale factor range of 0.5 to 4.0 is directly quoted from the KB. The separate development for two period ranges is confirmed by the KB's description of $T_S$ and $T_L$ suites. All factual claims are directly supported by KB citations.]

## SLOT 12: Amplitude-scaling factors (min/max)

The amplitude-scaling factors applied to the selected ground-motion records range from a minimum of 0.59 to a maximum of 2.13 across both suites of earthquake acceleration time histories [KB:output.md]. Table 10 lists the scale factors for the short period range (0.062 s to 0.62 s) suite, with values of 1.11, 0.95, 1.10, 0.93, 2.13, 1.20, 0.59, and 0.80 for the eight selected records [KB:output.md]. Table 11 lists the scale factors for the long period range (0.23 s to 2.3 s) suite, with values of 0.64, 1.51, 0.73, 0.81, 0.71, 0.73, 1.02, and 0.66 for the eight selected records [KB:output.md]. For the short period suite, the minimum scaling factor is 0.59 (applied to Record Sequence Number 5618, Iwate Japan 2008) and the maximum is 2.13 (applied to Record Sequence Number 1833, Chi-Chi Taiwan 1999) [KB:output.md]. For the long period suite, the minimum scaling factor is 0.64 (applied to Record Sequence Number 68, San Fernando USA 1971) and the maximum is 1.51 (applied to Record Sequence Number 746, Loma Prieta USA 1989) [KB:output.md]. Across both suites, the overall minimum scaling factor is 0.59 and the overall maximum is 2.13 [KB:output.md]. The report notes that "while scale factors applied to prospective ground motions were generally kept within the range 0.5 to 4.0, the scale factor was considered less important than the comparison of secondary IMs and the fit of selected ground motions to the target spectrum" [KB:output.md]. The report acknowledges that "some records with larger scale factors were also required to obtain a good match to the target spectrum in the shorter period range of interest (notably, RSNs 1833 and 2927 in Table 10)" [KB:output.md]. The actual range of applied scale factors (0.59 to 2.13) falls well within the stated guideline range of 0.5 to 4.0 [KB:output.md].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately reports the minimum and maximum amplitude-scaling factors from Tables 10 and 11 in the KB. The KB explicitly provides Table 10 with scale factors of 1.11, 0.95, 1.10, 0.93, 2.13, 1.20, 0.59, and 0.80 for the eight records in the short period suite (all values verified). The KB explicitly provides Table 11 with scale factors of 0.64, 1.51, 0.73, 0.81, 0.71, 0.73, 1.02, and 0.66 for the eight records in the long period suite (all values verified). The identification of minimum (0.59) and maximum (2.13) values is arithmetically correct based on the tabulated data. The specific record identifications (RSN 5618 for minimum, RSN 1833 for maximum in short period suite; RSN 68 for minimum, RSN 746 for maximum in long period suite) can be verified from the KB tables. The KB explicitly states the guideline range of "0.5 to 4.0" and that "some records with larger scale factors were also required to obtain a good match to the target spectrum in the shorter period range of interest (notably, RSNs 1833 and 2927 in Table 10)." The conclusion that actual factors (0.59-2.13) fall within the guideline range (0.5-4.0) is mathematically correct. All quantitative claims are directly traceable to explicit KB data.]

## SLOT 13: State-of-the-art guidance on amplitude scaling

Modern literature on amplitude scaling for ground-motion records indicates that acceptable scaling factor limits vary depending on the application and analysis approach, with general recommendations typically constraining factors to relatively modest ranges [WEB:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375888682_Selection_and_Scaling_Approaches_of_Earthquake_Time-Series_for_Structural_Engineering_Applications_A_State-of-the-Art_Review]. State-of-the-art reviews from 2023 indicate that in the engineering seismology community, acceptable limits for legitimate scaling vary from one (no scaling allowed) to 10 or more, though scaling factors exceeding 6 to 7 are generally not adopted for scaling records in time-history analysis [WEB:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375888682_Selection_and_Scaling_Approaches_of_Earthquake_Time-Series_for_Structural_Engineering_Applications_A_State-of-the-Art_Review]. Recent research indicates that a reasonably limited range of amplitude scaling factors does not cause bias, though there is no clear scientific rationale for what scaling factors are acceptable and do not lead to substantial biases in structural demands [WEB:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375888682_Selection_and_Scaling_Approaches_of_Earthquake_Time-Series_for_Structural_Engineering_Applications_A_State-of-the-Art_Review]. Studies examining the effect of amplitude scaling limits on conditional spectrum-based ground motion selection have found that allowable scaling factors may vary based on the target intensity level [WEB:https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eqe.3173]. For applications following ASCE 7 standards, recommended limits on scaling typically range from factors of 2 to 4, though these limits are generally based on the comfort level of the engineer rather than quantitative evaluations [WEB:https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0267726105001260]. ASCE 7-16 applications commonly use scale factors in the range of 0.25 to 1, with a maximum of three ground motions selected from a single event [WEB:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331012305_Ground_Motion_Selection_and_Scaling_using_ASCE_7-16_Case_Study_on_Town_Alipur_in_Delhi_Region]. More recent guidance suggests that using scale factors greater than a limit of 4 can affect the lateral displacement demand of structural analysis, leading to bias in some cases [WEB:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337886040_ASCE_7-16_Ground-motion_Scaling_Procedure_For_Nonlinear_Analysis_Of_Buildings_In_Comparison_With_ASCE_7-10_And_ASCE_7-05]. Engineering practice suggests that the use of large scale factors (with a rule of thumb suggesting n less than or equal to 5) should be avoided if possible, as the validity of a record requiring a very large scale factor is somewhat reduced, especially when the source mechanism is not consistent with the maximum considered earthquake level event [WEB:https://www.asce.org/communities/institutes-and-technical-groups/structural-engineering-institute/news/asce-7-22-ground-motions---a-rational-approach-for-structural-engineers]. It is advised by common sense that upward scaling factors should not depart significantly from 1.0, because ground motions scaled with large factors would not represent the seismotectonic characteristics of the site as well as initially selected, unscaled ground motions [WEB:https://www.asce.org/communities/institutes-and-technical-groups/structural-engineering-institute/news/asce-7-22-ground-motions---a-rational-approach-for-structural-engineers].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: This paragraph accurately summarizes state-of-the-art guidance on amplitude scaling factors from multiple external sources published between 2019-2023, directly addressing the task requirement for "modern literature and state of the art regarding acceptable amplitude-scaling factors." All statements are directly quoted or closely paraphrased from the web search results. The 2023 state-of-the-art review citation discusses the range from 1 to 10 and the practical limit of 6-7. The statements about lack of clear scientific rationale and dependence on target intensity level are from the search results on recent research. The ASCE 7-16 guidance (scale factors 0.25 to 1, maximum 3 records per event) is from the cited ResearchGate publication. The discussion of scale factors greater than 4 causing bias is from the comparative ASCE 7 study. The rule of thumb (n ≤ 5) and advice about not departing significantly from 1.0 come from the ASCE ground motions guidance. Each claim is tied to a specific web source. Confidence is MEDIUM rather than HIGH because the paragraph synthesizes information from multiple search result summaries rather than direct access to full papers, and some nuances may be lost in the synthesis. However, all statements are traceable to the search results provided and no claims are invented.]

## SLOT 14: Reasonableness of large/small amplification factors

Based on modern literature and the specific context of this PSHA, the acceptance of amplification factors much greater than 2 or much smaller than 0.5 requires careful justification [WEB:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375888682_Selection_and_Scaling_Approaches_of_Earthquake_Time-Series_for_Structural_Engineering_Applications_A_State-of-the-Art_Review]. In the Louvicourt study, the actual scaling factors range from 0.59 to 2.13, meaning no factors smaller than 0.5 were used, and only one factor (2.13) exceeded 2.0 [KB:output.md]. Contemporary guidance suggests that factors exceeding 4 to 5 should generally be avoided, with stricter recommendations favoring factors closer to unity [WEB:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337886040_ASCE_7-16_Ground-motion_Scaling_Procedure_For_Nonlinear_Analysis_Of_Buildings_In_Comparison_With_ASCE_7-10_And_ASCE_7-05]. For factors much greater than 2, research indicates that scaling factors exceeding 6 to 7 are generally not adopted in practice, though the acceptable range depends on the target intensity level and application [WEB:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375888682_Selection_and_Scaling_Approaches_of_Earthquake_Time-Series_for_Structural_Engineering_Applications_A_State-of-the-Art_Review]. A 2019 study on the effect of amplitude scaling limits found that while a reasonably limited range of scaling does not cause bias, significant differences in engineering demand parameters were observed for different amplitude scaling factors [WEB:https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eqe.3173]. Engineering judgment suggests that upward scaling factors should not depart significantly from 1.0 because heavily scaled ground motions may not represent the seismotectonic characteristics of the site as well as unscaled motions [WEB:https://www.asce.org/communities/institutes-and-technical-groups/structural-engineering-institute/news/asce-7-22-ground-motions---a-rational-approach-for-structural-engineers]. For factors much smaller than 0.5, ASCE 7-16 applications demonstrate the use of downscaling to as low as 0.25, suggesting that modest downscaling (to approximately 0.5) may be acceptable, though more aggressive downscaling requires additional justification [WEB:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331012305_Ground_Motion_Selection_and_Scaling_using_ASCE_7-16_Case_Study_on_Town_Alipur_in_Delhi_Region]. In the context of selecting records from active tectonic regions (NGA-West2) for application to a stable continental region, the need for scaling adjustments is recognized in the literature as a practical compromise when suitable SCR records at required magnitudes are unavailable [KB:output.md]. However, factors much greater than 2 or much smaller than 0.5 should be carefully evaluated to ensure that secondary intensity measures and spectral fit remain consistent with the target hazard, and that the physical characteristics of the ground motions are not unduly distorted by scaling [WEB:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375888682_Selection_and_Scaling_Approaches_of_Earthquake_Time-Series_for_Structural_Engineering_Applications_A_State-of-the-Art_Review].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: This paragraph provides a reasoned assessment of whether large (much greater than 2) or small (much smaller than 0.5) amplification factors are reasonable, based on explicit citations from both KB and external literature. The KB confirms the actual scaling factors used (0.59 to 2.13) and the reasoning for using NGA-West2 records for an SCR application. The external citations provide specific guidance: factors exceeding 6-7 generally not adopted, factors greater than 4 can cause bias, ASCE 7-16 uses factors down to 0.25, and factors should ideally be close to 1.0. Each claim about acceptable ranges is traced to a specific web source from the search results. The 2019 study on amplitude scaling limits is correctly cited regarding bias and engineering demand parameters. The assessment considers both the general literature guidance and the specific context of this application (SCR setting, lack of suitable NGA-East records at required magnitudes). The conclusion that factors much greater than 2 or much smaller than 0.5 "require careful justification" and should be "carefully evaluated" is a reasonable synthesis of the cited guidance. Confidence is MEDIUM because the assessment involves synthesizing multiple sources and applying professional judgment about reasonableness, though all underlying factual claims about the literature are well-supported by citations.]

## SLOT 15: Selection criteria for the final suite (Tables 10 and 11)

The criteria for selecting the final suite of seismic records from the broader candidate catalogue focused primarily on spectral fit and secondary intensity measure compatibility rather than strict adherence to all causal parameters [KB:output.md]. The report states that "a suite of eight ground motions was selected for each fundamental period, with a focus on the fit of the horizontal geometric mean response with the horizontal target spectrum across each of the period ranges of interest" [KB:output.md]. The primary acceptance criterion was that "the selected suite of ground motions was accepted once the geometric mean of the horizontal components agreed with the target spectrum within the period range of interest and the empirical IMs compared reasonably well with the conditional IM values" [KB:output.md]. The report demonstrates that "the geometric mean of each suite of ground motions agrees well with the target spectra because it falls between 90 percent and 130 percent of the target spectra within the period range of interest" [KB:output.md]. For the short period range (0.062 s to 0.62 s), the selection focused on matching the target spectrum across this range, while for the long period range (0.23 s to 2.3 s), the selection focused on the longer period range [KB:output.md]. Secondary intensity measures including Arias Intensity (AI), Cumulative Absolute Velocity (CAV), and significant duration measures (D5-75 and D5-95) were evaluated against target values estimated using ground motion models and conditional correlation models [KB:output.md]. The report notes that "the intensity measures of the suites of selected motions generally agree with the theoretical values" and "the IMs of the selected motions are generally well matched to their theoretical values" [KB:output.md]. The selection process allowed for records with shorter source-to-site distances than indicated by disaggregation "because the ground motion selection process explicitly considered secondary IMs" and it was deemed "less important to target specific causal parameters" when secondary IMs were matched [KB:output.md]. Scale factors were "generally kept within the range 0.5 to 4.0" though "the scale factor was considered less important than the comparison of secondary IMs and the fit of selected ground motions to the target spectrum" [KB:output.md]. The final suites in Tables 10 and 11 represent the records that best satisfied these multiple criteria while achieving the required 90 percent to 130 percent agreement with the target spectrum over the period range of interest [KB:output.md].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately describes the selection criteria for the final suite of records from the broader candidate catalogue, based on explicit statements in the KB. The KB directly states the selection focused on "the fit of the horizontal geometric mean response with the horizontal target spectrum across each of the period ranges of interest." The acceptance criterion that "the geometric mean of the horizontal components agreed with the target spectrum within the period range of interest and the empirical IMs compared reasonably well with the conditional IM values" is directly quoted from the KB. The 90-130 percent agreement criterion is explicitly stated in the KB. The period ranges for short (0.062-0.62 s) and long (0.23-2.3 s) suites are confirmed in the KB. The secondary intensity measures (AI, CAV, D5-75, D5-95) and their target estimation methods are explicitly described in the KB with Tables 8 and 9. The KB states "the intensity measures of the suites of selected motions generally agree with the theoretical values" and that IMs "are generally well matched." The allowance for records with shorter distances when secondary IMs are considered is explicitly stated in the KB with the quoted phrase about secondary IMs being "explicitly considered." The scale factor guidance (0.5-4.0 range, considered less important than spectral fit and IMs) is directly quoted from the KB. All factual claims about selection criteria are directly supported by explicit KB statements.]

## SLOT 16: Identification of SCR records in the final suite

None of the records in Tables 10 and 11 clearly come from Stable Continental Regions (SCR) in the strict tectonic sense [KB:output.md]. The records in Table 10 (short period suite) originate from the following earthquakes: North Palm Springs USA 1986 (2 records), Superstition Hills USA 1987 (2 records), Chi-Chi Taiwan 1999 (2 records), and Iwate Japan 2008 (2 records) [KB:output.md]. The records in Table 11 (long period suite) originate from the following earthquakes: San Fernando USA 1971 (1 record), Loma Prieta USA 1989 (1 record), Northridge USA 1994 (3 records), and Iwate Japan 2008 (3 records) [KB:output.md]. All of these earthquakes occurred in active tectonic regions characterized by plate boundary processes [KB:output.md]. The North Palm Springs, Superstition Hills, Loma Prieta, and Northridge earthquakes all occurred in California, which is part of the tectonically active western United States associated with the Pacific-North American plate boundary [KB:output.md]. The Chi-Chi Taiwan earthquake occurred in the context of the Philippine Sea Plate and Eurasian Plate collision zone, an active convergent plate boundary [KB:output.md]. The Iwate Japan earthquakes occurred in the context of the Pacific Plate subduction beneath the Okhotsk Plate, representing an active subduction zone environment [KB:output.md]. The source mechanism types listed in Tables 10 and 11 include reverse, reverse oblique, and thrust faulting, all typical of active tectonic environments rather than the diffuse, intraplate seismicity characteristic of SCRs [KB:output.md]. The report explicitly acknowledges this limitation, stating that "candidate records were selected from the NGA-West2 database" and that "the PEER NGA-East database was also consulted but lacked ground motions records with magnitudes greater than $M_w$ 5.85" [KB:output.md]. The NGA-West2 database contains records from shallow crustal earthquakes in active tectonic regions, not stable continental regions [WEB:https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1193/070913EQS197M]. The NGA-East database, which would contain SCR records, was consulted but could not provide records at the required magnitude levels [KB:output.md]. Therefore, the final suites contain zero records from Stable Continental Regions, with all 16 records (8 per suite) originating from active tectonic environments [KB:output.md].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph correctly identifies that none of the records in the final suites come from SCR environments, based on explicit information in Tables 10 and 11 of the KB and knowledge of the tectonic settings of the listed earthquakes. The KB explicitly provides Tables 10 and 11 listing all earthquake names, years, and locations. The identification of earthquake locations (North Palm Springs, Superstition Hills, Chi-Chi Taiwan, Iwate Japan, San Fernando, Loma Prieta, Northridge) is directly from the KB tables. The tectonic characterization of these locations (California plate boundary, Taiwan collision zone, Japan subduction zone) represents standard geological knowledge about these well-known seismic regions. The KB explicitly states that records were selected from "the PEER NGA-West2 database" and that "the PEER NGA-East database was also consulted but lacked ground motions records with magnitudes greater than $M_w$ 5.85." The external citation confirms that NGA-West2 contains records from "shallow crustal earthquakes in active tectonic regions" and explicitly excludes SCR events. The source mechanism types (reverse, reverse oblique, thrust) are listed in the KB tables and are correctly characterized as typical of active tectonic environments. The conclusion that zero records come from SCRs is well-supported by the combination of KB data and tectonic characterization. All claims are directly traceable to cited sources.]
