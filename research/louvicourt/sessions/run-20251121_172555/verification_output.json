      "paragraph": "The Louvicourt tailings storage facility site in southwestern Quebec is situated within the Canadian Shield physiographic province, which is part of the North American Craton [KB:output.md]. The Canadian Shield formed from the collision of Archean-age microcontinents during the Paleoproterozoic (2.5 to 1.6 Ga), with the microcontinents combining to form the ancient continent of Laurentia [KB:output.md]. This region is characterized as a stable continental region (SCR), specifically within the Central and Eastern North America (CENA) tectonic domain [KB:output.md]. The site is located within the Abitibi Sub-province of the Superior Province, near the boundary with the Pontiac Sub-province, marked by the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone [KB:output.md]. The tectonic regime controlling seismicity within the 1000 km radius is that of a cratonic interior, where seismicity is infrequent, diffuse, and generally not associated with mapped geological structures [KB:output.md] [WEB:https://www.usgs.gov/data/scr_catalog.php]. The Canadian Shield represents one of the oldest known cratons containing rocks dating back several billion years [KB:output.md]. This stable continental regime influences the PSHA by producing relatively low seismicity rates, large epicentral distances for controlling earthquakes, and ground motion attenuation characteristics distinct from those in active tectonic regions [KB:output.md]. The seismic source model implemented for this PSHA is the sixth-generation seismic hazard model of Canada (CanadaSHM6), which was specifically developed for southeastern Canada by the Geological Survey of Canada [KB:output.md]. The CanadaSHM6 incorporates areal seismic sources that represent the diffuse seismicity characteristic of stable continental regions rather than discrete fault sources [KB:output.md].",

The report confirms that major fault zones in the region, including the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone, are not included as discrete seismic sources because they are presently seismically and geologically inactive, lacking earthquake epicenter alignments and geomorphic evidence for past surface fault rupture [KB:output.md].

The PSHA report provides Table 6, which summarizes the average distance, magnitude, and epsilon from magnitude-distance disaggregation of hazard from all sources [KB:output.md]. For the 1/2,475 AEP (close to the 1/475 to 1/1000 range), the modal magnitude values range from $M_w$ 6.8 to $M_w$ 7.4 across different spectral periods [KB:output.md]. The modal epicentral distances for these frequent hazard levels range from approximately 90 km to 180 km [KB:output.md].

The PSHA report explicitly states that the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone, a major structural complex located approximately 10 km from the site, is not included as a discrete seismic source [KB:output.md]. The report provides several lines of evidence for this exclusion: the nature of the fault zone rocks, their present-day tectonic setting within the Canadian Shield, a lack of earthquake epicenter alignments along the fault, and no geomorphic evidence for past surface fault rupture [KB:output.md]. The report notes that while three earthquake epicenters near the site are located within the wider Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone, earthquakes are absent in other parts of the fault zone, indicating that the fault is presently seismically and geologically inactive [KB:output.md]. Similarly, other major fault zones within the wider region are not included as discrete seismic sources for the same reasons [KB:output.md]. The seismic source model defines known active and potentially active seismic sources as faults where there is evidence of surface displacement during the Upper Pleistocene stage of the Pleistocene Epoch (i.e., about the last 126,000 years) [KB:output.md].

The report states that maximum earthquake magnitudes are estimated based on observed earthquakes, historical estimates, and instrumentally recorded earthquakes, and/or empirical relationships between fault parameters and earthquake magnitude [KB:output.md]. In the CanadaSHM6 seismic source model adopted for this study, the logic tree includes three alternative $M_{max}$ branches that are collapsed into a single magnitude-frequency distribution (MFD) branch for computational efficiency [KB:output.md]. The report notes that while collapsing these branches had a negligible impact on median hazard values, it limits the ability to perform detailed analysis of the fractiles or model input sensitivity tests [KB:output.md]. The $M_{max}$ values are incorporated as epistemic uncertainty parameters in the PSHA logic tree rather than as deterministic MCE scenarios [KB:output.md]. The report does not specify the actual $M_{max}$ values assigned to individual seismic sources within the CanadaSHM6 model, as these parameters are adopted without modification from the published CanadaSHM6 source model [KB:output.md].

The selection was performed to support advanced geotechnical stability analyses of the Louvicourt TSF, with ground motions amplitude-scaled to represent the mean uniform hazard spectrum (UHS) for the 1/10,000 AEP at the site seismic ground condition of $V_{S30}$ equals 1,853 m/s [KB:output.md]. Two suites of eight, two-horizontal-component EATHs were developed for two different fundamental periods: a shorter period ($T_S$) in the range 0.25 s to 0.37 s, and a longer period ($T_L$) of approximately 1.15 s [KB:output.md]. The main selection steps were as follows. First, the 1/10,000 AEP hazard disaggregation results were reviewed, and a representative set of causal parameters (earthquake magnitude and rupture distance) was selected [KB:output.md]. Second, target secondary intensity measures (IMs) consistent with the 1/10,000 AEP hazard were estimated using an earthquake scenario based on the causal parameters from disaggregation, with magnitude $M_w$ equals 7.3 and rupture distance $r_{rup}$ equals 170 km [KB:output.md]. Third, a catalogue of candidate ground motion records with generally similar causal parameters was developed from the PEER NGA-West2 and NGA-East databases [KB:output.md]. Fourth, candidate ground motions were amplitude-scaled to be in general agreement with the target spectrum, with a focus on the fit of the horizontal geometric mean response with the target spectrum across the period ranges of interest [KB:output.md]. Fifth, the secondary IMs of each selected, scaled horizontal ground motion record were compared with the estimated conditional IM values [KB:output.md].

The Canadian Shield represents one of the oldest known cratons containing rocks dating back several billion years and is characterized by generally stable continental crust that has not experienced major tectonism, magmatism, basement metamorphism, or anorogenic intrusion since the early Cretaceous. The regional tectonic setting within a 1000 km radius around the project site is dominated by the Stable Continental Region classification, where seismicity occurs within ancient cratonic rocks that have persisted through multiple cycles of continental rifting, basin formation, contraction, folding, faulting, and uplift. The site lies specifically within the Abitibi Sub-province of the Superior Province, positioned near the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone, which marks the boundary between the Abitibi and Pontiac sub-provinces. This tectonic regime influences seismicity relevant to the probabilistic seismic hazard assessment through its characteristic low rates of crustal deformation, absence of active plate boundary conditions, and diffuse distribution of earthquake epicenters that are generally not associated with mapped surface faults. Historical seismicity analysis indicates the site is within a region of relatively low earthquake occurrence, with only five earthquakes of moment magnitude greater than 4.5 recorded within approximately 300 km of the Louvicourt site, the largest being the 1935 Timiskaming earthquake at magnitude 6.1 located approximately 190 km southwest of the mine. The diffuse seismicity pattern and lack of concentrated earthquake activity along major fault zones such as the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone indicate that these structures are presently seismically and geologically inactive despite their prominent geological expression. The tectonic regime therefore contributes to the hazard through distributed background seismicity within stable continental crust rather than through identifiable active fault sources, which fundamentally shapes the seismic source model used in the probabilistic assessment.

Each sub-model defines areal seismic source zones that represent regions of distributed seismicity within the stable continental crust rather than discrete fault sources. The seismic sources include zones such as Charlevoix, Gatineau, and other areas within the southeastern Canada model domain, all of which are characterized by intraplate seismicity occurring within ancient cratonic rocks of the Canadian Shield and adjacent stable platform regions. The ground motion models selected for the assessment explicitly recognize this source classification, as the 17 NGA-East ground motion models were developed specifically for central and eastern North America, which is tectonically characterized as a Stable Continental Region. The absence of any active tectonic features, plate boundaries, or identified active neotectonic faults within the source model confirms the uniform Stable Continental Crust classification for all contributing sources. The decision to use NGA-East models rather than ground motion prediction equations developed for active crustal regions reflects the fundamental tectonic distinction between stable continental interiors and active plate margin environments. No non-Stable Continental Crust sources are included in the site-specific seismic source model, and the entire probabilistic analysis framework from source characterization through ground motion prediction is predicated on the stable continental tectonic regime that characterizes southeastern Canada.

The magnitude-distance-epsilon disaggregation analysis for the 1/2,475 annual exceedance probability hazard level shows that for peak ground acceleration, the mean magnitude bin is 6.6 to 6.8 with mean distance of 140 to 160 km, while the modal values are magnitude 7.2 to 7.4 at distance 160 to 180 km. For spectral acceleration at 0.2 second period, the controlling magnitudes shift slightly higher with mean and median bins of 6.8 to 7.0 and mode of 7.0 to 7.2, all occurring at distances centered around 160 to 180 km. At longer spectral periods representative of structural response, specifically 0.5 second and 1.0 second periods, the controlling scenarios show mean magnitudes of 7.0 to 7.2 with distances increasing to 220 to 240 km mean for 0.5 second and 260 to 280 km mean for 1.0 second period, though the modal distance remains 160 to 180 km across these periods. The epsilon values associated with these controlling scenarios range from 0.5 to 1.5, indicating that the hazard at this probability level is driven by ground motions that are between 0.5 and 1.5 standard deviations above the median ground motion prediction for the given magnitude-distance combinations. The disaggregation results reveal that the dominant seismic source zones contributing to the frequent hazard levels are the Charlevoix source zone in the Historical sub-model and its equivalent in the Hybrid sub-model, along with significant contributions from the Gatineau source zone. These controlling event characteristics reflect the regional seismicity pattern of southeastern Canada where moderate to large intraplate earthquakes at intermediate distances dominate the seismic hazard across all spectral periods evaluated.

The disaggregation results for the 1/5,000 annual exceedance probability show that across all spectral periods from peak ground acceleration through 1.0 second, the controlling magnitudes are in the range of moment magnitude 6.8 to 7.4, with most scenarios concentrated in the 7.0 to 7.4 range. Specifically, for peak ground acceleration at 1/5,000 annual exceedance probability, the mean magnitude is 6.8 to 7.0 with modal magnitude of 7.2 to 7.4, occurring at mean and modal distances of 140 to 160 km. For the 1/10,000 annual exceedance probability hazard level, the controlling scenarios show further progression toward larger magnitudes with values predominantly in the 6.8 to 7.4 range and modal values consistently at 7.2 to 7.4 across all spectral periods evaluated. At this rarest hazard level, distances show slight reduction with mean values ranging from 120 to 240 km depending on spectral period, with peak ground acceleration controlled by events at 120 to 140 km mean distance, spectral acceleration at 0.2 second controlled at 140 to 160 km, and longer periods at 180 to 240 km mean distance. The modal distance for the 1/10,000 annual exceedance probability remains 160 to 180 km across most spectral periods, indicating that this distance band represents a persistent contributor to the hazard regardless of probability level. The epsilon values for these rare hazard levels are predominantly 1.5, indicating that the rare ground motion levels are achieved through earthquakes producing shaking approximately 1.5 standard deviations above the median predicted ground motion. These controlling event characteristics demonstrate that at rare return periods, the hazard is dominated by the potential for larger magnitude earthquakes in the 7.0 to 7.4 range occurring at distances between approximately 120 km and 240 km, with the same source zones identified for frequent hazards continuing to control the rare hazard contributions.

The site is located approximately 10 km north of the main Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone contact, which represents a major structural complex marking the boundary between the Abitibi and Pontiac sub-provinces of the Superior Province. While the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone is a prominent geological feature with complex internal structure including numerous subsidiary faults and shear zones, the available evidence indicates it is not presently active in the seismological sense. The analysis of earthquake epicenter distribution shows that although three epicenters near the site are located within the wider Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone, earthquakes are notably absent in other parts of the fault zone, and the few observed events do not exhibit alignment patterns characteristic of active fault rupture. Foundation excavations for Dam 1 exposed bedrock that is relatively closely jointed, intruded by diabase dykes, and cut by numerous faults and shear zones with predominately northwest-southeast and north-northwest-south-southeast strikes and moderate to steep dips, but these mapped structures represent localized deformation associated with ancient tectonic processes during the development of the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone rather than evidence of recent or ongoing fault activity. The nature of the fault zone rocks consisting of Archean-age metamorphosed and deformed materials, their present-day tectonic setting within the stable Canadian Shield, the lack of earthquake epicenter alignments along the fault traces, and the absence of geomorphic evidence for Quaternary surface fault rupture all support the interpretation that the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone and other major fault zones within the wider region are geologically inactive. Based on these observations, no discrete fault sources are included in the site-specific seismic source model, and the seismicity within 100 km of the site is instead modeled using areal source zones that represent distributed background seismicity within the stable continental crust.

      "paragraph": "The probabilistic seismic hazard assessment for the Louvicourt site does not explicitly define or calculate a Maximum Credible Earthquake for any specific seismic source in the traditional deterministic sense. Instead, the assessment implements maximum magnitude values as part of the earthquake recurrence characterization for each areal seismic source zone within the CanadaSHM6 source model framework. The seismic source model incorporates maximum earthquake magnitudes through a logic tree approach that includes three alternative maximum magnitude branches as part of the magnitude-frequency distribution characterization for each source zone. These maximum magnitude values represent the upper bound of earthquake sizes considered possible within each source zone and are derived from analysis of historical earthquake records, observed earthquakes in similar tectonic settings, and empirical relationships applicable to stable continental regions. The maximum magnitude parameters are integrated into the probabilistic calculation as truncation points for the Gutenberg-Richter frequency-magnitude relationships that characterize earthquake recurrence for each source, expressed through the relationship $\\log N = a - b M$ where $N$ is the cumulative number of earthquakes greater than or equal to moment magnitude $M_w$ per year, and $a$ and $b$ are constants representing activity rate and magnitude distribution respectively. The logic tree framework developed for the assessment captures epistemic uncertainty in maximum magnitude estimates by weighting alternative values, and these branches were collapsed into a single magnitude-frequency distribution branch for computational efficiency while maintaining negligible impact on median hazard values. The maximum magnitude concept in this probabilistic framework differs fundamentally from a deterministic Maximum Credible Earthquake in that it is not used to directly calculate ground motions for a specific scenario, but rather serves as an upper bound parameter in the integration over all possible earthquake magnitudes, distances, and ground motion levels that contribute to the probabilistic hazard at each annual exceedance probability. The assessment does not indicate that any individual fault-specific Maximum Credible Earthquake was defined, consistent with the characterization of seismicity in the region as distributed background activity within areal source zones rather than as discrete fault sources with identifiable maximum rupture scenarios.

      "paragraph": "The development of earthquake acceleration time histories for the Louvicourt Tailings Storage Facility involved a systematic process to select and scale real ground-motion records to match the site-specific uniform hazard spectrum at the 1/10,000 annual exceedance probability for two distinct structural fundamental periods. The selection process began with review of the hazard disaggregation results to identify representative causal parameters, specifically earthquake magnitude and rupture distance, that control the probabilistic hazard at the target return period. Based on the disaggregation analysis showing dominant contributions from earthquakes with magnitudes around 6.8 to 7.5 and distances of approximately 100 to 200 km, a representative scenario of moment magnitude 7.3 at rupture distance of 170 km was established for ground motion selection. Additional earthquake source parameters were assumed based on engineering judgment of reasonable values for stable continental region earthquakes, including hypocentral depth of 20 km, depth to top of rupture of 10 km, and rupture plane dip of 90 degrees. Target secondary intensity measures including cumulative absolute velocity, Arias intensity, and significant durations were calculated for the scenario using established ground motion models and conditioned to the target spectrum at each of the two fundamental periods of interest. A catalogue of candidate ground motion records was compiled from the PEER NGA-West2 database covering magnitude range 6.0 to 7.8 and distance range 0 to 200 km, with relatively loose initial bounds employed because secondary intensity measures were explicitly considered in the selection process. The NGA-East database was consulted but found to lack sufficient records with magnitudes greater than 5.85. Candidate ground motions were then amplitude-scaled to achieve general agreement with the target spectrum, and suites of eight two-component records were selected for each fundamental period with focus on fitting the horizontal geometric mean response to the target spectrum within the period range of interest. The secondary intensity measures of the selected scaled records were compared with the conditional intensity measure values to verify overall consistency. The final suites were accepted once the geometric mean of the horizontal components agreed with the target spectrum within 90 to 130 percent across the period range of interest and the empirical intensity measures compared reasonably with the conditional values. This multi-step process ensured that the selected earthquake acceleration time histories represent appropriate seismic demand characteristics for the site considering both spectral shape and duration-related ground motion parameters relevant to geotechnical response analysis.

      "paragraph": "The 170 km rupture distance used as a selection criterion originates directly from the magnitude-distance-epsilon disaggregation analysis performed for the 1/10,000 annual exceedance probability hazard level at the Louvicourt site. The disaggregation results presented for peak ground acceleration and spectral periods of 0.2 second, 0.5 second, and 1.0 second at the 1/10,000 annual exceedance probability show modal distance bins consistently at 160 to 180 km across all spectral periods evaluated, with mean distance values ranging from approximately 120 km for peak ground acceleration to 240 km for 1.0 second spectral period. The selected value of 170 km represents the center of the modal distance bin and serves as a single representative distance for the ground motion selection process. This distance is specifically valid for the 1/10,000 annual exceedance probability return period, which corresponds to approximately a 10,000-year return period, and was the target hazard level for earthquake acceleration time history development as specified in the project scope. The disaggregation analysis reveals that while mean distances show systematic increase with increasing spectral period, reflecting the tendency for longer-period ground motions to have contributions from more distant sources, the modal distance remains relatively stable at 160 to 180 km, indicating that this distance range represents a persistent and dominant contributor to the hazard across the spectral period range of interest. The use of a single representative distance rather than different distances for different spectral periods is consistent with practical ground motion selection methodology where a limited number of time history records must represent the distributed nature of probabilistic hazard contributions. The 170 km distance applies to both the short fundamental period suite and the long fundamental period suite of earthquake acceleration time histories, though the actual selected records in the final suites have source-to-site distances that vary considerably from this target value, with many records having shorter distances in order to achieve better spectral matching to the high-frequency content of the target uniform hazard spectrum. The disaggregation results also show that the 170 km distance is associated with the controlling magnitude scenarios in the range 7.0 to 7.4, confirming the coupled relationship between the selected magnitude of 7.3 and distance of 170 km as representative of the modal disaggregation bin for the 1/10,000 annual exceedance probability hazard.

The depth-to-top of rupture and rupture plane dip parameters are not standard metadata fields reported in the NGA-West2 ground motion database for all records, and the information presented in Tables 10 and 11 does not include these parameters in the reported characteristics of the selected earthquake acceleration time histories. The tables report record sequence number, earthquake name, year, recording station, source mechanism type, earthquake magnitude, rupture distance, site ground condition, and scale factor, but do not list depth-to-top of rupture or dip angle for the selected records. Examination of the source mechanism types listed in Table 10 shows a variety of faulting styles including reverse oblique, strike slip, reverse, and normal mechanisms, which would be associated with various dip angles rather than consistently vertical 90-degree faults. For example, reverse and reverse oblique mechanisms typically involve dipping faults at angles substantially less than 90 degrees, often in the range of 30 to 60 degrees. The NGA-West2 database does contain rupture geometry parameters for many records, but these parameters are not uniformly available for all events and were evidently not used as strict selection criteria for the Louvicourt suites. The ground motion selection methodology described in the report emphasizes spectral matching to the target uniform hazard spectrum and compatibility of secondary intensity measures as the primary selection criteria, with the depth-to-top rupture and dip parameters serving as inputs to the scenario definition for calculating target intensity measures rather than as filters for candidate record selection. The selection approach prioritized achieving good spectral fit and appropriate duration characteristics over strict matching of source geometry parameters, which reflects practical recognition that the available database of recorded strong motion from large magnitude earthquakes at appropriate distances is limited, and that spectral compatibility is more critical to structural response than precise matching of rupture geometry for the distributed seismicity sources that characterize the Louvicourt hazard.

The NGA-West2 database developed by the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center contains processed strong motion recordings from significant earthquakes worldwide, primarily from active tectonic regions, and was selected as the source database due to the limited availability of strong motion records from large magnitude stable continental region earthquakes. The candidate catalogue was constructed by extracting records from the NGA-West2 database with magnitudes ranging from 6.0 to 7.8 and source-to-site distances from 0 to 200 km, which bracket the modal disaggregation scenario of magnitude 7.3 at distance 170 km while allowing sufficient flexibility to build a diverse candidate pool. The relatively wide bounds on magnitude and distance were intentionally employed because the ground motion selection process explicitly considered secondary intensity measures including Arias intensity, cumulative absolute velocity, and significant durations, and this approach permits greater flexibility in causal parameters when the secondary characteristics are matched. The NGA-East database, which contains recordings from stable continental regions in central and eastern North America, was also consulted as a potential source but was found to lack ground motion records with magnitudes greater than 5.85, making it unsuitable for selecting records to represent the magnitude 7.3 controlling scenario. No specific filters were applied for site ground conditions during the initial candidate catalogue development because site amplification differences would be addressed through the amplitude scaling process, though the database contains records from a range of site conditions characterized by time-averaged shear wave velocity over 30 meters. The selection process did not impose strict limits on scale factors during the candidate identification phase, with scale factors generally targeted within the range 0.5 to 4.0 but with recognition that achieving good spectral match to the target uniform hazard spectrum might require factors outside this range in some cases. The candidate catalogue development represents the initial screening step that produced a pool of prospective records from which the final suites of eight two-component time histories for each fundamental period were selected through the subsequent steps of amplitude scaling, spectral matching evaluation, and secondary intensity measure comparison.

For the short period range suite presented in Table 10, which covers the fundamental period range of 0.25 to 0.37 seconds with scaling optimized over the period range 0.062 to 0.62 seconds, the scale factors range from a minimum of 0.59 for record 5618 from the 2008 Iwate Japan earthquake to a maximum of 8.28 for record 1833 from the 1999 Hector Mine earthquake. Another notably large scale factor in the short period suite is 6.85 applied to record 2927 from the Chi-Chi Taiwan earthquake. The remaining records in the short period suite have more moderate scale factors including 1.11, 0.95, 3.19, 1.90, and 0.80. For the long period range suite presented in Table 11, which covers the fundamental period of 1.15 seconds with scaling optimized over the period range 0.23 to 2.3 seconds, the scale factors range from a minimum of 0.64 for record 68 from the 1971 San Fernando earthquake to a maximum of 2.87 for record 923 from the 1992 Big Bear earthquake. The long period suite scale factors show a more restricted range compared to the short period suite, with values of 0.64, 1.51, 2.67, 2.33, 2.87, 1.51, 1.71, and 0.77. The presence of scale factors exceeding 4.0 and as high as 8.28 in the short period suite represents a departure from commonly suggested practical limits of 0.5 to 4.0 or 0.25 to 4.0 that appear in some ground motion selection guidance, though the report notes these large factors were necessary to obtain good match to the target spectrum particularly at shorter periods. The range of scale factors across both suites extends from 0.59 to 8.28, representing a span of approximately 14 times between the minimum and maximum scaling applied. The large scale factors were applied to achieve spectral compatibility particularly in the high-frequency range where the target uniform hazard spectrum for the stable continental region bedrock site exhibits relatively high acceleration levels that are not well represented by unscaled recordings from the active tectonic region database.

The fundamental selection requirement was that the geometric mean of the horizontal components of the suite of eight two-component records must fall between 90 percent and 130 percent of the target mean uniform hazard spectrum for the 1/10,000 annual exceedance probability across the period range of interest, which was 0.062 to 0.62 seconds for the short period suite and 0.23 to 2.3 seconds for the long period suite. Candidate records were evaluated for their ability to match the target spectrum through amplitude scaling, with the scaling factors adjusted to optimize the spectral fit within each period range. Beyond spectral matching, the secondary intensity measures of the scaled candidate records were compared against conditional target values for Arias intensity, cumulative absolute velocity, and significant durations calculated for the representative magnitude 7.3 and distance 170 km scenario. Records whose scaled secondary intensity measures compared reasonably well with the conditional intensity measure distributions were preferred, though strict matching of all secondary measures was not enforced as an absolute requirement. The selection process accepted records once the combined criteria of geometric mean spectral agreement within the 90 to 130 percent band and general consistency with secondary intensity measure targets were satisfied. The final suites presented in Tables 10 and 11 include records from various earthquakes worldwide drawn from the NGA-West2 database, encompassing different tectonic settings, source mechanisms including reverse, reverse oblique, strike-slip, and normal faulting, and a range of source-to-site distances predominantly shorter than the 170 km target distance. The evaluation of whether the final suites satisfy the selection criteria stated at the beginning of chapter 8.0 indicates general compliance with the spectral matching requirements, as the figures showing response spectra demonstrate good agreement between the geometric mean of the selected suites and the target spectrum within the period ranges of interest. The secondary intensity measures of the selected scaled records show distributions that generally encompass or slightly exceed the conditional target values, with the cumulative probability plots indicating reasonable though not perfect agreement. The selection process achieved the primary objective of providing suites of time histories that represent the 1/10,000 annual exceedance probability target hazard spectrum with appropriate consideration of ground motion duration characteristics, though the use of large scale factors for some records and shorter source-to-site distances than indicated by disaggregation represents practical accommodation to the limited availability of suitable recordings from stable continental region earthquakes.

All eight records in the short period suite listed in Table 10 are from earthquakes in active tectonic settings, including the North Palm Springs earthquakes in southern California, Hector Mine earthquake in California, Chi-Chi earthquake sequence in Taiwan, Umbria Marche earthquake in Italy, and Iwate earthquake in Japan, all of which occurred in regions characterized by active crustal deformation associated with plate boundaries or active intraplate tectonic processes. Similarly, all eight records in the long period suite listed in Table 11 are from active tectonic region earthquakes, including San Fernando earthquake in California, Loma Prieta earthquake in California, Landers earthquake in California, Big Bear earthquakes in California, and Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan. The classification of these source regions is determined by their tectonic setting, with California earthquakes associated with the San Andreas fault system and related structures along the Pacific-North American plate boundary, Taiwan earthquakes related to the collision between the Philippine Sea Plate and the Eurasian Plate, Japanese earthquakes associated with subduction zone tectonics and volcanic arcs, and Italian earthquakes related to the complex convergent boundary between the African and Eurasian plates. The absence of any Stable Continental Region records in the final suites reflects the practical limitation that the NGA-East database, which contains recordings from stable continental regions in central and eastern North America, lacks ground motion records from earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 5.85, making it unsuitable as a source for records to represent the magnitude 7.3 controlling scenario identified from the hazard disaggregation. This limitation necessitated the use of the NGA-West2 database, which predominantly contains recordings from active tectonic regions, combined with amplitude scaling to achieve compatibility with the stable continental region target spectrum derived from the NGA-East ground motion models and site-specific hazard analysis. The selected records therefore represent active tectonic region earthquakes that have been scaled to match the spectral characteristics and secondary intensity measures expected for stable continental region ground motions at the Louvicourt site, an approach that is commonly employed in engineering practice for stable continental region sites where the inventory of suitable recorded strong motions from appropriate tectonic settings is limited.

At 1/5,000 AEP, the modal magnitude values are $M_w$ 7.2-7.4 across all spectral periods (PGA, 0.2 s, 0.5 s, 1.0 s), with rupture distances ranging from 140-220 km and modal values concentrated at 140-160 km for shorter periods and 160-180 km for longer periods [KB:output.md]. The epsilon values for these scenarios are consistently 1.5 across all periods [KB:output.md]. For the 1/10,000 AEP hazard level, the controlling magnitudes remain in the $M_w$ 7.2-7.4 modal range for all spectral periods, with rupture distances of 120-240 km and modal values of 160-180 km [KB:output.md]. The epsilon values are again uniformly 1.5 across all periods at this hazard level [KB:output.md]. The dominant contributors to seismic hazard at these rare exceedance probabilities are moderate to large magnitude earthquakes (approximately $M_w$ 6.8 to $M_w$ 7.4) at distances of about 100 km to 200 km from the Louvicourt TSF site [KB:output.md]. The three primary seismic source zones controlling this rare hazard are Charlevoix (CHV) in the H2 sub-model, Charlevoix (CHVHY) in the HY sub-model, and Gatineau (GAT), which are the same zones dominating the frequent hazard levels [KB:output.md]. The remarkable consistency of modal distance (160-180 km) across both hazard levels and all spectral periods indicates that the controlling earthquakes originate from similar epicentral locations regardless of the return period, with the primary variation occurring in the magnitude distribution rather than spatial location [KB:output.md].",

The nature of the fault zone rocks, their present-day tectonic setting within the Canadian Shield, a lack of earthquake epicenter alignments, and no geomorphic evidence for past surface fault rupture all indicate that the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone and other major fault zones within the wider region are at present seismically and geologically inactive [KB:output.md].

The site has two fundamental periods of interest: a short period range with $T_S$ = 0.25-0.37 s and a long period $T_L$ = 1.15 s [KB:output.md]. The selection followed a six-step approach beginning with review of disaggregation results to establish causal parameters, which identified a modal scenario of magnitude $M_w$ 7.3 at rupture distance 170 km as the target [KB:output.md]. The second step estimated target values for secondary intensity measures (IMs) including Cumulative Absolute Velocity (CAV), Arias Intensity (AI), and significant duration (D5-75, D5-95) using a scenario with hypocentral depth of 20 km, depth to top of rupture of 10 km, and rupture plane dip of 90 degrees, which were assumed based on judgment of reasonable values for earthquakes occurring in stable continental regions [KB:output.md]. The third step created a catalogue of candidate records from the PEER NGA-West2 database covering magnitude range $M_w$ 6.0 to 7.8 and distance range 0 to 200 km, as the NGA-East database lacked ground motion records with magnitudes greater than $M_w$ 5.85 [KB:output.md]. Scale factors applied to prospective ground motions were generally kept within the range 0.5 to 4.0, though the scale factor was considered less important than the comparison of secondary IMs and the fit to the target spectrum [KB:output.md]. In the fourth step, candidate records were amplitude-scaled to match the target spectrum and eight records per suite were selected, followed by comparison of secondary IMs of scaled records with conditional IM values in step five [KB:output.md]. The final step accepted the suite when the geometric mean agreed with the target spectrum between 90% and 130% within the period ranges of interest (0.062 s to 0.62 s for short period, 0.23 s to 2.3 s for long period) and empirical IMs compared reasonably well with conditional IM values [KB:output.md]. The selected suites include records with shorter source-to-site distances than suggested by disaggregation results, which is commonly used when applying earthquake ground motions from plate boundary areas to intraplate stable continental regions and was necessary to capture high-frequency ground motions for the stiff site conditions [KB:output.md].",

The Canadian Shield represents one of the oldest known cratons globally, containing rocks dating back several billion years and formed from the collision of Archean-age microcontinents during the Paleoproterozoic period spanning 2.5 to 1.6 billion years ago [KB:output.md]. This tectonic setting is characterized as a Stable Continental Region (SCR), also referred to as Central and Eastern North America (CENA) in ground motion modeling contexts [KB:output.md]. Within approximately 1000 km of the site, the dominant seismotectonic regime is that of intraplate seismicity occurring within ancient cratonic crust, where earthquakes are generated by stress accumulation within the stable continental lithosphere rather than along active plate boundaries [KB:output.md]. The region exhibits relatively low historical earthquake activity compared to active tectonic margins, with only five earthquakes of moment magnitude $M_w$ greater than 4.5 recorded within 300 km of the site since historical records began [KB:output.md]. The largest historical event in the broader region was the 1935 Timiskaming earthquake with magnitude $M_w$ 6.1, located approximately 190 km southwest of the Louvicourt site [KB:output.md]. The seismic hazard within the 1000 km radius is dominated by several seismic source zones defined in the sixth-generation Canadian seismic hazard model (CanadaSHM6), with the Charlevoix seismic zone representing the largest contributor to hazard across multiple return periods, followed by the Gatineau source zone [KB:output.md]. These source zones represent areas of concentrated historical seismicity within the broader stable continental regime, where localized stress concentrations or crustal weaknesses facilitate earthquake generation despite the overall tectonic stability of the craton [KB:output.md]. The CanadaSHM6 model divides southeastern Canada into multiple seismic source zones based on three alternative sub-models: the Historical (H2) model based on earthquake locations and magnitudes, the Regional (R2) model based on geological criteria, and the Hybrid (HY) model combining both approaches [KB:output.md].",

The assessment adopts the CanadaSHM6 seismic source model for southeastern Canada without modification, which was developed specifically for the tectonically stable region of the Canadian Shield and surrounding areas [KB:output.md]. The ground motion models selected for the assessment reflect this stable continental classification, as the study employs the final suite of 17 NGA-East (Next Generation Attenuation for Central and Eastern North America) ground motion models specifically developed for stable continental regions in central and eastern North America [KB:output.md]. The NGA-East models were chosen because they were developed through a robust process for tectonic regions classified as SCR, matching the tectonic environment surrounding the Louvicourt site [KB:output.md]. The report explicitly states that these ground motion models are suitable because they model earthquake ground motion attenuation for stable continental regions like that surrounding the Louvicourt TSF site [KB:output.md]. No active tectonic sources, subduction zones, or crustal sources characteristic of plate boundary regions are included in the seismic source model [KB:output.md]. The major mapped fault zones in the region, including the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone located approximately 10 km from the site, are not classified as active seismic sources because they lack evidence of recent activity, show no alignment of earthquake epicenters along their traces, and exhibit no geomorphic evidence for Quaternary surface fault rupture [KB:output.md]. These ancient fault zones, while prominent geological structures formed during Archean orogenic events, are considered seismically and geologically inactive under present-day tectonic conditions within the stable craton [KB:output.md].

Specifically, at peak ground acceleration (PGA), the mean distance bin is 140-160 km, the median is 140-160 km, and the mode is 160-180 km, with corresponding mean magnitude bin of $M_w$ 6.6-6.8, median of $M_w$ 6.8-7.0, and mode of $M_w$ 7.2-7.4 [KB:output.md].

The epsilon values (number of standard deviations above the median ground motion) for the 1/2475 AEP range from 0.5 to 1.5, indicating that ground motions at this hazard level are generally within one to two standard deviations above the median predictions [KB:output.md].

The major fault structure in the immediate vicinity is the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone, which marks the boundary between the Abitibi and Pontiac sub-provinces of the Superior Province [KB:output.md]. The Louvicourt site is located within the wider Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone, approximately 10 km north of the main sub-province contact [KB:output.md]. However, this fault zone is classified as geologically and seismically inactive under present-day tectonic conditions [KB:output.md]. Multiple lines of evidence support the conclusion that the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone and other major mapped fault zones in the region are not active neotectonic faults [KB:output.md]. First, earthquake epicenters in the region are widely distributed and show no alignment or concentration along the traces of these major mapped faults [KB:output.md]. While three earthquake epicenters near the site are located within the wider Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone, earthquakes are notably absent in other parts of the fault zone, precluding interpretation of fault-controlled seismicity [KB:output.md]. Second, there is no geomorphic evidence for surface fault rupture during the Quaternary period, specifically during the Upper Pleistocene (approximately the last 126000 years), which is the standard timeframe for defining active faults in seismic hazard assessment [KB:output.md]. Third, the nature of the fault zone rocks and their present-day tectonic setting within the stable Canadian Shield craton do not indicate ongoing tectonic activity [KB:output.md]. The Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone represents an ancient structural complex formed during Archean orogenic events more than 2.5 billion years ago, and has not exhibited evidence of reactivation under the current low-stress intraplate tectonic regime [KB:output.md]. Consequently, the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone and other major fault zones within the wider region are not included as discrete seismic sources in the site-specific seismic source model developed for the Louvicourt assessment [KB:output.md].

      "paragraph": "The concept of a Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE) is addressed indirectly in the PSHA through the specification of maximum magnitude ($M_{max}$) values assigned to each seismic source zone in the CanadaSHM6 model [KB:output.md]. However, the report does not explicitly define or calculate a single discrete MCE value for any specific fault or seismic source [KB:output.md]. Instead, the maximum earthquake magnitudes are incorporated into the probabilistic framework through the magnitude-frequency distribution (MFD) branches of the logic tree [KB:output.md]. The CanadaSHM6 model originally included three alternative $M_{max}$ branches as part of the logic tree structure to represent epistemic uncertainty in the maximum possible earthquake size for each source zone [KB:output.md]. However, for computational efficiency, the two MFD branches comprising three alternative recurrence parameter (a- and b-values) branches and three alternative $M_{max}$ branches were collapsed into a single MFD branch in the implementation used for this assessment [KB:output.md]. The report notes that while collapsing these branches had negligible impact on median hazard values, it limits the ability to perform detailed analysis of fractiles or model input sensitivity tests related to maximum magnitudes [KB:output.md]. The maximum earthquake magnitudes in the CanadaSHM6 model are estimated based on multiple lines of evidence including observed earthquakes, historical earthquake size estimates, instrumentally recorded earthquakes, and empirical relationships between fault parameters such as fault area and maximum or average single-event slip [KB:output.md]. For the seismic source zones contributing most significantly to hazard at the Louvicourt site, particularly the Charlevoix and Gatineau zones, the assigned maximum magnitudes implicitly represent the upper bound on earthquake size considered credible for these sources [KB:output.md]. The disaggregation results showing modal magnitudes in the $M_w$ 7.2 to $M_w$ 7.4 range for rare hazard levels suggest that the maximum magnitudes assigned to the dominant source zones are in the range of $M_w$ 7.5 or greater, though specific $M_{max}$ values for individual sources are not reported in the PSHA document [KB:output.md].

The selection methodology began with review of the hazard disaggregation results to identify representative causal parameters including earthquake magnitude and rupture distance, leading to selection of a modal scenario with magnitude $M_w$ 7.3 and rupture distance 170 km [KB:output.md]. Additional scenario parameters were specified based on engineering judgment for stable continental regions, including hypocentral depth of 20 km, depth to top of rupture of 10 km, and rupture plane dip of 90 degrees [KB:output.md]. Target secondary intensity measures including cumulative absolute velocity (CAV), Arias intensity (AI), and significant durations ($D_{5-75}$ and $D_{5-95}$) were estimated using published ground motion models and conditioned to the 1/10000 AEP hazard level at two fundamental periods representing the short-period ($T_S$ = 0.31 s) and long-period ($T_L$ = 1.15 s) characteristics of the TSF embankments [KB:output.md].

The NGA-East database was consulted but lacked records with magnitudes greater than $M_w$ 5.85, necessitating reliance on the NGA-West2 database of recordings from active tectonic regions [KB:output.md]. Candidate ground motions were amplitude-scaled to achieve general agreement with the target spectrum, with scale factors generally kept within the range 0.5 to 4.0, though this constraint was considered less important than achieving good spectral match and secondary intensity measure agreement [KB:output.md].

The disaggregation results presented in Figure 17 and Table 6 show the magnitude-distance-epsilon joint probability mass distribution for the 1/10000 AEP across multiple spectral periods [KB:output.md]. For peak ground acceleration (PGA) at 1/10000 AEP, the modal distance bin is 160-180 km, while mean and median distances are in the 120-140 km range [KB:output.md]. For the 0.2-second spectral period at 1/10000 AEP, the mean and median distances are both 140-160 km, with the mode at 160-180 km [KB:output.md]. For longer periods including 0.5 seconds and 1.0 second at 1/10000 AEP, the modal distance bins remain at 160-180 km, while mean distances extend to 180-200 km and 220-240 km respectively [KB:output.md]. The selection of 170 km as the target rupture distance represents a central value within the modal distance bin of 160-180 km that appears consistently across all analyzed spectral periods at the 1/10000 AEP [KB:output.md]. This distance is therefore valid specifically for the 1/10000 AEP hazard level, which corresponds to a return period of 10000 years [KB:output.md]. The report notes that the disaggregation shows the largest contribution to the 1/10000 AEP seismic hazard comes from earthquakes with magnitudes of about $M_w$ 6.8 to $M_w$ 7.5 and source-to-site distances of about 100 km to 200 km for both shorter spectral periods such as 0.2 seconds and longer spectral periods such as 1.0 second [KB:output.md]. The 170 km distance is notably longer than the actual distances of many records ultimately selected, as Tables 10 and 11 show selected records with rupture distances ranging from 11 km to 159 km, with most records having distances significantly shorter than 170 km [KB:output.md]. The report explicitly addresses this discrepancy, explaining that shorter source-to-site distances were required to achieve adequate spectral matching, particularly for high-frequency content, due to the difference between the stiff site conditions at Louvicourt ($V_{S30}$ = 1853 m/s) and the generally softer site conditions where the NGA-West2 database records were originally recorded [KB:output.md]. The 170 km distance therefore serves as the target hazard-consistent scenario distance, but practical record selection considerations necessitated use of closer-distance records from active tectonic regions to achieve the required spectral characteristics [KB:output.md].",

      "paragraph": "The candidate ground motion records were selected by the WSP project team using explicit criteria based on magnitude, distance, and database source [KB:output.md]. The PEER NGA-West2 database was identified as the primary source for creating the catalogue of prospective ground motions [KB:output.md]. The selection criteria for the candidate catalogue included magnitude ranging from $M_w$ 6.0 to $M_w$ 7.8 and source-to-site distance from 0 to 200 km for each period range of interest, parameters chosen to be consistent with the disaggregation results while providing sufficient flexibility to build an adequate candidate pool [KB:output.md]. The PEER NGA-East database, which contains recordings from stable continental regions more directly analogous to the Louvicourt tectonic setting, was also consulted during the candidate selection process [KB:output.md]. However, the NGA-East database lacked ground motion records with magnitudes greater than $M_w$ 5.85, making it unsuitable as a primary source for the target scenario magnitude of $M_w$ 7.3 [KB:output.md]. The report explicitly states that relatively loose bounds were used for earthquake magnitude and distance because the ground motion selection process explicitly considered secondary intensity measures such as cumulative absolute velocity, Arias intensity, and significant durations [KB:output.md]. This approach recognizes that by explicitly considering these secondary intensity measures that capture duration and energy content of ground motions, it becomes less important to target specific causal parameters such as exact earthquake magnitude [KB:output.md]. Consequently, site parameters including $V_{S30}$ were not limited in creating the prospective ground motion catalogues in order to increase the number of prospective motions available in the candidate pool [KB:output.md]. The magnitude range of $M_w$ 6.0 to $M_w$ 7.8 encompasses the target magnitude of $M_w$ 7.3 with reasonable bounds approximately one magnitude unit below and half a magnitude unit above [KB:output.md]. The distance range of 0 to 200 km spans from very close sources to distances at the upper end of the disaggregation-indicated range of 100 to 200 km, providing candidates across the full range of potentially contributing scenarios [KB:output.md]. These criteria defined the initial candidate pool from which the final eight-record suites for short-period and long-period applications were ultimately selected through subsequent spectral matching and intensity measure comparison steps [KB:output.md].",

      "paragraph": "The amplitude-scaling factors applied to the selected ground motion records span a wide range from 0.59 to 8.28 for the short-period suite and from 0.64 to 2.87 for the long-period suite [KB:output.md]. For the short-period range (0.062 s to 0.62 s), Table 10 shows that the minimum scaling factor is 0.59 applied to record RSN 5618 from the 2008 Iwate, Japan earthquake, while the maximum scaling factor is 8.28 applied to record RSN 1833 from the 1999 Hector Mine earthquake [KB:output.md]. Other notably large scaling factors in the short-period suite include 6.85 for RSN 2927 from the Chi-Chi, Taiwan-04 earthquake and 3.19 for RSN 3185 from the Chi-Chi, Taiwan-05 earthquake [KB:output.md]. The remaining four records in the short-period suite have more moderate scaling factors ranging from 0.80 to 1.90 [KB:output.md]. For the long-period range (0.23 s to 2.3 s), Table 11 shows that the minimum scaling factor is 0.64 applied to record RSN 68 from the 1971 San Fernando earthquake, while the maximum scaling factor is 2.87 applied to record RSN 923 from the Big Bear-01 earthquake [KB:output.md]. The majority of records in the long-period suite have scaling factors between 1.51 and 2.67, with only two records (RSN 68 at 0.64 and RSN 6060 at 0.77) having factors below unity [KB:output.md]. The report notes that while scale factors applied to prospective ground motions were generally kept within the range 0.5 to 4.0, the scale factor was considered less important than the comparison of secondary intensity measures and the fit of selected ground motions to the target spectrum [KB:output.md]. This statement indicates that the 0.5 to 4.0 range was a guideline rather than a strict constraint, as evidenced by the selection of two records with factors substantially exceeding 4.0 in the short-period suite [KB:output.md]. The report explicitly acknowledges that some records with larger scale factors were required to obtain a good match to the target spectrum in the shorter period range of interest, specifically noting RSNs 1833 and 2927 as examples where large scaling factors were necessary [KB:output.md]. The geometric mean of the scaling factors provides a more moderate characterization of the overall amplitude adjustment, though this value is not explicitly reported in the tables [KB:output.md].",

      "slot": "SLOT 15: Selection criteria for the final suite (Tables 10 and 11)",
      "paragraph": "The final suite of ground motion records was selected based on a multi-criteria evaluation approach that prioritized spectral compatibility and secondary intensity measure matching over strict adherence to magnitude and distance parameters. Each suite contains eight two-horizontal-component records, for a total of 16 records across both the short period and long period suites [KB:output.md]. The primary acceptance criterion was that the geometric mean of each suite of ground motions must agree well with the target spectra, specifically falling between 90% and 130% of the target spectra within the period range of interest [KB:output.md]. For the short period suite, the applicable period range was 0.062 s to 0.62 s (defined as 0.2$T_S^*$ to 2.0$T_S^*$ where $T_S^*$ = 0.31 s), while the long period suite was evaluated over 0.23 s to 2.3 s (0.2$T_L^*$ to 2.0$T_L^*$ where $T_L^*$ = 1.15 s) [KB:output.md]. The secondary criterion involved matching of intensity measures (IMs) of the selected motions to theoretical target values, with the report indicating that the IMs of the selected motions generally agree with the theoretical values for Arias Intensity (AI), Cumulative Absolute Velocity (CAV), and significant duration (D5-75, D5-95) as listed in Tables 8 and 9 [KB:output.md]. The target values for the short period conditioning were AI = 0.098 m/s and CAV = 5.46 m/s, while for long period conditioning the targets were AI = 0.073 m/s and CAV = 5.10 m/s, with duration targets of D5-75 = 5.66 s and D5-95 = 10.50 s applied uniformly across both suites [KB:output.md]. The selection process explicitly allowed the IMs of the scaled motions to be slightly higher relative to the target IMs, with average values of scaled IMs slightly greater than the median of the respective target IMs, representing a conservative bias that was deemed acceptable [KB:output.md]. The general acceptance statement indicates that the selected suite was accepted once the geometric mean of the horizontal components agreed with the target spectrum within the period range of interest and the empirical IMs compared reasonably well with the conditional IM values, with \"reasonably well\" representing a qualitative assessment rather than a strict numerical threshold [KB:output.md]. Notably, the final selection criteria relaxed the magnitude and distance matching relative to the modal disaggregation values ($M_w$ 7.3, 170 km), with the selected suites including records with significantly shorter source-to-site distances than suggested by the disaggregation results, justified by the need to achieve appropriate spectral shape and high-frequency content for the stiff site conditions [KB:output.md]. The candidate catalogue was constructed with magnitude range 6.0-7.8 and distance range 0-200 km, and the actual selected records span magnitudes approximately 6.0-7.6 with distances predominantly in the range 11-159 km, demonstrating that spectral shape and secondary IM matching were prioritized over scenario parameter matching [KB:output.md].",

      "paragraph": "None of the ground motion records in the final suites (Tables 10 and 11) originate from Stable Continental Region (SCR) earthquakes; all 16 records are from active tectonic or plate boundary regions. The candidate records were selected exclusively from the PEER NGA-West2 database, which contains active crustal earthquakes, due to the lack of records with the required causal parameters in the NGA-East database, which is the primary repository for SCR ground motions [KB:output.md]. The NGA-East database was consulted but was found to lack ground motion records with magnitudes greater than $M_w$ 5.85, making it unsuitable for the target scenario of $M_w$ 7.3 [KB:output.md]. In the short period suite (Table 10), all eight records are from active tectonic settings: two from the 1986 North Palm Springs earthquake in California (RSN 516, 530) characterized by reverse oblique mechanisms in the San Andreas fault system, one from the 1999 Hector Mine earthquake in California (RSN 1833) with strike-slip mechanism in the Mojave region, three from Chi-Chi Taiwan earthquakes in 1999 (RSN 2927, 3185) with strike-slip and reverse mechanisms in a subduction-related active setting, one from the 1997 Umbria Marche earthquake in Italy (RSN 4347) with normal mechanism in the active Apennines, and two from the 2008 Iwate earthquake in Japan (RSN 5618, 5773) with reverse mechanisms in an active subduction zone [KB:output.md]. In the long period suite (Table 11), all eight records are similarly from active regions: one from the 1971 San Fernando earthquake in California (RSN 68) with reverse mechanism, two from the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake in California (RSN 746, 774) with reverse oblique mechanisms, two from the 1992 Landers earthquake in California (RSN 869) with strike-slip mechanism in the Mojave, two from the 1992 Big Bear-01 earthquake in California (RSN 923, 6060) with strike-slip mechanism, and two from Chi-Chi Taiwan earthquakes in 1999 (RSN 1474, 3471) with reverse oblique and reverse mechanisms [KB:output.md]. The regional distribution shows 11 records (69%) from California, 4 records (25%) from Taiwan, 2 records (13%) from Japan, and 1 record (6%) from Italy, all representing active plate boundary tectonic environments [KB:output.md]. The justification provided for using exclusively active crustal records for the SCR site is that the selection of records with shorter source-to-site distances from plate boundary areas is commonly used when applying earthquake ground motions to intraplate stable continental regions, and that the selected motions have engineering intensity measures that are consistent with the hazard based on intraplate conditions, making them suitable for engineering analyses at the Louvicourt TSF site [KB:output.md].",
