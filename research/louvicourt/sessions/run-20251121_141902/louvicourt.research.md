# Seismotectonic and Ground Motion Record Selection Analysis for Louvicourt TSF

## SLOT 1: Tectonic regimes within 1000 km

The Louvicourt TSF site is located within a Stable Continental Region (SCR) tectonic regime, specifically in the Canadian Shield, which forms part of the North American Craton. Cratons are regions containing very old rocks (more than 1 Ga) and are usually tectonically stable parts of the continental lithosphere that have persisted through several cycles of continental rifting and basin formation [KB:output.md]. The site is situated in southwestern Quebec within the Canadian Shield physiographic province, with local bedrock composed of Archean and Proterozoic basement rocks exceeding 2.7 billion years in age [KB:output.md]. The region is part of the ancient continent of Laurentia, formed during the Paleoproterozoic (2.5 to 1.6 Ga), and is located specifically within the Superior Province, Abitibi Sub-province [KB:output.md]. This tectonic setting is explicitly classified as SCR for central and eastern North America (CENA), and the 17 NGA-East ground motion models (GMMs) used in the probabilistic seismic hazard assessment (PSHA) reflect the most up-to-date published and vetted GMMs developed for stable continental regions [KB:output.md]. The SCR regime influences seismicity relevant to the PSHA by establishing the site as an intraplate setting with no active plate boundaries within 1000 km, resulting in relatively infrequent but potentially moderate to large magnitude earthquakes occurring within diffuse areal source zones rather than on discrete active faults [KB:output.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All claims are directly supported by extensive documentation in the KB source. The tectonic classification as SCR/CENA is stated explicitly at lines 413, 621, and 796. Geological ages (Archean/Proterozoic >2.7 Ga, Laurentia 2.5-1.6 Ga) are specified at lines 314-318. The Superior Province/Abitibi Sub-province location is confirmed at line 332. The characterization of cratons as tectonically stable regions persisting through continental cycles is quoted directly from line 316. The use of 17 NGA-East GMMs specific to SCR is documented at line 413. The influence on seismicity (intraplate, no active boundaries, diffuse sources) is consistent with the seismic source model description at lines 199, 320, 341, 368-376, showing all sources are areal (not discrete faults) and no active faults included. All citations traceable to [KB:output.md].]

## SLOT 2: Source type classification (SCC)

All seismic sources included in the site-specific seismic source model for the Louvicourt TSF are of Stable Continental Crust (SCR) type. The entire seismic source model uses the CanadaSHM6 framework for southeastern Canada, which consists of three sub-models: Historical (H2), Regional (R2), and Hybrid (HY), with logic tree weights of 0.4, 0.2, and 0.4 respectively [KB:output.md]. All sub-models consist exclusively of areal seismic sources, defined as sources not known or associated with mapped faults, rather than discrete fault sources [KB:output.md]. The major structural features in the region, including the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone located within 10 km of the site, are at present seismically and geologically inactive, as evidenced by the nature of fault zone rocks, their present-day tectonic setting within the Canadian Shield, lack of earthquake epicenter alignments, and no geomorphic evidence for past surface fault rupture [KB:output.md]. Accordingly, these faults are not included as discrete seismic sources in the site-specific seismic source model [KB:output.md]. The three primary controlling source zones identified in the hazard deaggregation are Charlevoix (CHV) in the H2 sub-model as the largest contributor, Charlevoix (CHVHY) in the HY sub-model as the second largest contributor, and Gatineau (GAT) as the third largest contributor [KB:output.md]. All ground motion models applied in the PSHA are SCR-specific, comprising 17 NGA-East GMMs developed for CENA/SCR conditions [KB:output.md]. No active crustal (AC) sources characteristic of plate boundary regions are identified or modeled within the assessment area, and no subduction zone sources exist within the region [KB:output.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The classification of all sources as SCR type is comprehensively supported. The CanadaSHM6 framework composition (H2/R2/HY sub-models with weights 0.4/0.2/0.4) is documented at line 376. The definition of areal sources as non-fault-associated is from line 199. The explicit statement that major faults including Cadillac-Larder Lake are "seismically and geologically inactive" and "not included as discrete seismic sources" is directly quoted from line 320. The identification of controlling source zones (CHV, CHVHY, GAT) is from hazard deaggregation results at line 446. The use of 17 NGA-East GMMs specific to SCR is confirmed at line 413. The absence of active crustal and subduction sources is established by the exclusive use of SCR areal sources and GMMs. All information traces to [KB:output.md] with specific line references provided in extraction report.]

## SLOT 3: Controlling events for frequent hazard levels

The KB document does not provide disaggregation results specifically for frequent annual exceedance probabilities (AEP) of 1/475 to 1/1000 years as requested. The closest available hazard level in the PSHA results is 1/2,475 AEP (approximately a 2,475-year return period), which represents a more rare event than the specified frequent range [KB:output.md]. For the 1/2,475 AEP hazard level, the controlling earthquake scenarios vary by spectral period. At peak ground acceleration (PGA), the modal magnitude range is $M_w$ 7.2-7.4 at rupture distances of 160-180 km, with epsilon values of 0.5-1.5 [KB:output.md]. For spectral period 0.2 s, the controlling scenarios have magnitudes $M_w$ 7.0-7.2 at distances of 160-180 km with epsilon of 1.5 [KB:output.md]. At 0.5 s period, magnitudes increase to $M_w$ 7.0-7.2 with distances of 160-240 km (mode 160-180 km) and epsilon of 0.5-1.5, while at 1.0 s period, the controlling magnitudes are $M_w$ 7.2-7.4 at distances of 160-280 km (mode 160-180 km) with epsilon of 1.5 [KB:output.md]. The three primary seismic source zones controlling this hazard are Charlevoix (CHV) in the H2 sub-model as the largest contributor, Charlevoix (CHVHY) in the HY sub-model as the second largest contributor, and Gatineau (GAT) as the third largest contributor [KB:output.md]. The lack of disaggregation data for the requested 1/475 to 1/1000 AEP range represents a gap in the available PSHA results, and accurate characterization of controlling scenarios for these more frequent hazard levels would require additional calculations or reference to supplementary literature not present in the KB [KB:output.md].^[Verdict: UNCERTAIN, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: The paragraph accurately reports what is available in the KB (1/2,475 AEP data from Table 6, lines 565-573) and clearly identifies the gap: the requested 1/475-1/1000 AEP data is not provided. The magnitude ranges ($M_w$ 7.0-7.4), distance ranges (160-280 km with mode 160-180 km), and epsilon values (0.5-1.5) for 1/2,475 AEP are correctly extracted from the KB. The controlling source zones (CHV, CHVHY, GAT) are verified at line 446. However, the verdict is UNCERTAIN rather than TRUE because the paragraph does not answer the original question (frequent hazard at 1/475-1/1000 AEP) but instead reports the closest available data (1/2,475 AEP). The paragraph explicitly acknowledges this limitation and correctly characterizes it as a gap requiring additional analysis. The statement is factually accurate about what the KB contains, but incomplete regarding the research question, warranting UNCERTAIN classification.]

## SLOT 4: Controlling events for rare hazard levels

For rare annual exceedance probabilities between 1/5,000 and 1/10,000 years, the PSHA disaggregation results reveal consistent controlling earthquake scenarios across spectral periods. At 1/5,000 AEP, the modal magnitude values are $M_w$ 7.2-7.4 across all spectral periods (PGA, 0.2 s, 0.5 s, 1.0 s), with rupture distances ranging from 140-220 km and modal values concentrated at 140-160 km for shorter periods and 160-180 km for longer periods [KB:output.md]. The epsilon values for these scenarios are consistently 1.5 across all periods [KB:output.md]. For the 1/10,000 AEP hazard level, the controlling magnitudes remain in the $M_w$ 7.2-7.4 modal range for all spectral periods, with rupture distances of 120-240 km and modal values of 160-180 km [KB:output.md]. The epsilon values are again uniformly 1.5 across all periods at this hazard level [KB:output.md]. The dominant contributors to seismic hazard at these rare exceedance probabilities are moderate to large magnitude earthquakes (approximately $M_w$ 6.8 to $M_w$ 7.4) at distances of about 100 km to 200 km from the Louvicourt TSF site [KB:output.md]. The three primary seismic source zones controlling this rare hazard are Charlevoix (CHV) in the H2 sub-model, Charlevoix (CHVHY) in the HY sub-model, and Gatineau (GAT), which are the same zones dominating the frequent hazard levels [KB:output.md]. The remarkable consistency of modal distance (160-180 km) across both hazard levels and all spectral periods indicates that the controlling earthquakes originate from similar epicentral locations regardless of the return period, with the primary variation occurring in the magnitude distribution rather than spatial location [KB:output.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All quantitative claims are directly supported by Table 6 (lines 574-581) in the KB. The 1/5,000 AEP magnitude range ($M_w$ 7.2-7.4 mode), distance range (140-220 km with mode 140-160 to 160-180 km), and epsilon (1.5) are extracted from lines 574-577. The 1/10,000 AEP values (magnitude $M_w$ 7.2-7.4 mode, distance 120-240 km with mode 160-180 km, epsilon 1.5) are from lines 578-581. The summary statement about controlling magnitudes $M_w$ 6.8-7.4 at distances 100-200 km is directly quoted from line 779 in Section 9.0 Conclusions. The identification of controlling source zones (CHV, CHVHY, GAT) is confirmed at line 446 and is consistent across hazard levels. The observation about consistency of modal distance is a valid interpretation of the tabulated data showing 160-180 km mode across all periods and both hazard levels. All citations trace to [KB:output.md] with specific documentation in extraction report.]

## SLOT 5: Active neotectonic faults within 100 km

No active neotectonic faults have been identified within 100 km of the Louvicourt TSF site. The nearest major structural feature is the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone, within which the site is located approximately 10 km north of the main sub-Province contact [KB:output.md]. The nature of the fault zone rocks, their present-day tectonic setting within the Canadian Shield, a lack of earthquake epicenter alignments, and no geomorphic evidence for past surface fault rupture all indicate that the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone and other major fault zones within the wider region are at present seismically and geologically inactive [KB:output.md]. Local faults observed in the foundation at the site presumably represent localized deformation associated with the development of the nearby Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone but are ancient structural features rather than neotectonic features [KB:output.md]. The regional faults are Archean in age (more than 2.5 Ga old), significantly predating the Upper Pleistocene stage (approximately the last 126,000 years) typically used as the criterion for identifying active faults in PSHA [KB:output.md]. The seismicity record further supports this assessment, with only five earthquakes with moment magnitudes more than 4.5 recorded within approximately 300 km of the Louvicourt TSF site, and earthquakes are absent in most parts of the fault zone [KB:output.md]. The largest historical earthquake in the wider region is the 1935 Timiskaming earthquake ($M_w$ 6.1), located approximately 190 km southwest of the site [KB:output.md]. Accordingly, no faults within 100 km are included as discrete seismic sources in the site-specific seismic source model developed for this study [KB:output.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The conclusion of no active neotectonic faults is strongly supported by multiple lines of evidence in the KB. The explicit statement that Cadillac-Larder Lake and other regional faults are "seismically and geologically inactive" is directly quoted from line 320. The four supporting criteria (fault zone rocks, tectonic setting, lack of epicenter alignments, no geomorphic evidence) are listed at line 320. The site's location within/near Cadillac-Larder Lake (10 km north of main contact) is from line 334. The characterization of local faults as ancient deformation features (not neotectonic) is from line 334. The Archean age (>2.5 Ga) is documented at lines 318, 332. The Upper Pleistocene criterion (126,000 years) for active faults in PSHA is from line 341. The sparse seismicity (only five $M_w$ >4.5 events within 300 km) is from line 324. The 1935 Timiskaming earthquake ($M_w$ 6.1, 190 km SW) is from line 324. The statement that faults are "absent" in most parts is from line 320. The conclusion that no faults are included as discrete sources is from line 320. All evidence converges to support the claim of no active neotectonic faults. Citations all trace to [KB:output.md].]

## SLOT 6: Consideration of Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE)

The term Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE) is not explicitly defined or calculated in the WSP PSHA report for the Louvicourt TSF. The PSHA framework instead uses a probabilistic approach to maximum magnitude ($M_{max}$) estimation based on observed earthquakes, historical estimates, instrumentally recorded earthquakes, and empirical relationships between fault parameters [KB:output.md]. The CanadaSHM6 source model incorporates three alternative $M_{max}$ branches in the logic tree, which were collapsed into a single magnitude-frequency distribution (MFD) branch for computational efficiency [KB:output.md]. The specific $M_{max}$ values for each seismic source zone are not explicitly stated in the KB document but are referenced as part of the CanadaSHM6 source model parameters from Kolaj et al. (2023) [KB:output.md]. The historical seismicity record provides an empirical upper bound, with the largest known earthquake in the wider region being the 1935 Timiskaming event at $M_w$ 6.1 located approximately 190 km southwest of the site [KB:output.md]. The hazard disaggregation results show controlling magnitudes ranging from $M_w$ 6.8 to $M_w$ 7.4 for rare return periods, with modal values extending to approximately $M_w$ 7.4-7.6 [KB:output.md]. The minimum magnitude considered in the hazard calculation is $M_w$ 4.8, and the ground motion models are applicable across a range from $M_w$ 4.0-4.8 at the lower bound to $M_w$ 8.0-8.2 at the upper bound [KB:output.md]. While a deterministic MCE in the traditional sense is not explicitly defined, the probabilistic framework implicitly considers maximum magnitudes through the $M_{max}$ distributions in the CanadaSHM6 source model, which represent the upper magnitude limit for each seismic source zone [KB:output.md].^[Verdict: UNCERTAIN, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: The paragraph accurately reports that MCE terminology is not used in the PSHA (search of KB confirms no mention of "MCE" or "Maximum Credible Earthquake"). The existence of $M_{max}$ estimation methodology is verified at line 228 ("maximum earthquake magnitudes (Mmax) are estimated based on observed earthquakes, historical estimates, and instrumentally recorded earthquakes, and/or empirical relationships"). The logic tree structure with three $M_{max}$ branches collapsed to single MFD is from line 427. The reference to Kolaj et al. (2023) for specific values is at line 429. The 1935 Timiskaming earthquake ($M_w$ 6.1, 190 km SW) is from line 324. The controlling magnitude range $M_w$ 6.8-7.4 is from line 779 and Table 6. The minimum magnitude $M_w$ 4.8 is from line 230. The GMM magnitude ranges (AA13: $M_w$ 4.8-8.0 at line 399; NGA-East: $M_w$ 4-8.2 at line 405) are accurately cited. However, verdict is UNCERTAIN because specific $M_{max}$ values for each source zone are not provided in KB, creating a gap. The paragraph honestly characterizes this gap and correctly interprets the probabilistic approach as an implicit consideration of maximum magnitudes. Citations all trace to [KB:output.md].]

## SLOT 7: Executive summary of ground-motion record selection

The ground-motion record selection procedure for the Louvicourt TSF developed two suites of eight two-horizontal-component earthquake acceleration time histories (EATHs) each, targeting the 1/10,000 AEP mean uniform hazard spectrum (UHS) for a site with shear wave velocity $V_{S30}$ = 1,853 m/s [KB:output.md]. The site has two fundamental periods of interest: a short period range with $T_S$ = 0.25-0.37 s and a long period $T_L$ = 1.15 s [KB:output.md]. The selection followed a six-step approach beginning with review of disaggregation results to establish causal parameters, which identified a modal scenario of magnitude $M_w$ 7.3 at rupture distance 170 km as the target [KB:output.md]. The second step estimated target values for secondary intensity measures (IMs) including Cumulative Absolute Velocity (CAV), Arias Intensity (AI), and significant duration (D5-75, D5-95) using a scenario with hypocentral depth of 20 km, depth to top of rupture of 10 km, and rupture plane dip of 90 degrees, which were assumed based on judgment of reasonable values for earthquakes occurring in stable continental regions [KB:output.md]. The third step created a catalogue of candidate records from the PEER NGA-West2 database covering magnitude range $M_w$ 6.0 to 7.8 and distance range 0 to 200 km, as the NGA-East database lacked ground motion records with magnitudes greater than $M_w$ 5.85 [KB:output.md]. Scale factors applied to prospective ground motions were generally kept within the range 0.5 to 4.0, though the scale factor was considered less important than the comparison of secondary IMs and the fit to the target spectrum [KB:output.md]. In the fourth step, candidate records were amplitude-scaled to match the target spectrum and eight records per suite were selected, followed by comparison of secondary IMs of scaled records with conditional IM values in step five [KB:output.md]. The final step accepted the suite when the geometric mean agreed with the target spectrum between 90% and 130% within the period ranges of interest (0.062 s to 0.62 s for short period, 0.23 s to 2.3 s for long period) and empirical IMs compared reasonably well with conditional IM values [KB:output.md]. The selected suites include records with shorter source-to-site distances than suggested by disaggregation results, which is commonly used when applying earthquake ground motions from plate boundary areas to intraplate stable continental regions and was necessary to capture high-frequency ground motions for the stiff site conditions [KB:output.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This comprehensive summary is fully supported by Chapter 8.0 of the KB. The two suites of eight two-component EATHs targeting 1/10,000 AEP UHS at $V_{S30}$ = 1,853 m/s is from line 613. The fundamental periods ($T_S$ = 0.25-0.37 s, $T_L$ = 1.15 s) are from line 615. The six-step approach is outlined at lines 617-636. The target scenario ($M_w$ 7.3, 170 km) is from lines 624, 648. The secondary IMs (CAV, AI, D5-75, D5-95) and scenario parameters (depth 20 km, ztor 10 km, dip 90°) are from lines 621-629. The justification as "reasonable values for stable continental regions" is directly quoted from line 621. The NGA-West2 database selection (magnitude 6.0-7.8, distance 0-200 km) is from line 677. The statement about NGA-East lacking records >$M_w$ 5.85 is from line 677. The scale factor range 0.5-4.0 and prioritization of secondary IMs over scaling magnitude is from line 677. The six steps are accurately described from lines 619-636. The acceptance criteria (90-130% spectral match) is from line 683. The period ranges (0.062-0.62 s short, 0.23-2.3 s long) are from line 646. The use of shorter distances and rationale (plate boundary to intraplate, high-frequency capture) is from lines 687-690. All citations trace to [KB:output.md].]

## SLOT 8: Adequacy of basic selection criteria (M 7.3, Rrup 170 km, etc.)

The selection criteria of magnitude $M_w$ 7.3 and rupture distance 170 km are well-justified by the PSHA disaggregation results and are appropriate for the stable continental region tectonic setting. The disaggregation analysis for 1/10,000 AEP shows that the largest contribution to seismic hazard comes from earthquakes with magnitudes of approximately $M_w$ 6.8 to $M_w$ 7.5 and source-to-site distances of approximately 100 km to 200 km for both shorter spectral periods (0.2 s) and longer spectral periods (1.0 s) [KB:output.md]. The mean, median, and mode values for magnitude and distance generally agree at both shorter and longer spectral periods, with modal values from the disaggregation indicating $M_w$ 7.2-7.4 and distances of 160-180 km across all spectral periods examined (PGA, 0.2 s, 0.5 s, 1.0 s) [KB:output.md]. The selected magnitude $M_w$ 7.3 falls precisely within the modal magnitude range of 7.2-7.4, and the distance of 170 km represents the midpoint of the modal distance bin of 160-180 km [KB:output.md]. The consistency of these modal values across different spectral periods provides confidence that the selected parameters are representative of the controlling scenarios [KB:output.md]. The additional scenario parameters assumed for the stable continental region setting include a hypocentral depth of 20 km, depth to top of rupture of 10 km, and rupture plane dip of 90 degrees, which were judged to be reasonable values for earthquakes occurring in stable continental regions such as southeastern Canada [KB:output.md]. However, the KB document does not provide explicit external validation of whether these specific criteria represent best practice for SCR ground motion selection, nor does it compare the selected parameters to other SCR PSHA studies or contemporary guidance documents on SCR seismic hazard analysis [KB:output.md]. The deeper hypocentral depth of 20 km is consistent with intraplate seismicity occurring within crystalline crust, and the vertical rupture plane (dip 90 degrees) is appropriate for the diffuse seismicity characteristic of stable continental regions where specific fault structures are not identified [KB:output.md].^[Verdict: UNCERTAIN, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: The paragraph's claims about disaggregation support are well-documented in KB. The magnitude range $M_w$ 6.8-7.5 and distance range 100-200 km for 1/10,000 AEP are from line 648. Agreement of mean/median/mode values is stated at line 648. The modal values ($M_w$ 7.2-7.4, distances 160-180 km) across all spectral periods are extracted from Table 6 lines 578-581. The correspondence of $M_w$ 7.3 to modal range and 170 km to modal bin midpoint is correctly interpreted from Table 6. The scenario parameters (depth 20 km, ztor 10 km, dip 90°) and SCR justification are from lines 621-627. However, the verdict is UNCERTAIN because: (1) the paragraph correctly notes that KB lacks explicit validation against external SCR best practices, (2) no comparison to other SCR PSHA studies is provided in KB, (3) the adequacy assessment requires external literature not present in KB (identified as MODERATE GAP in extraction report at Slot 8), (4) the claims about deeper depth and vertical dip being "appropriate" are reasonable interpretations but not explicitly validated in the KB citations. The paragraph honestly characterizes these limitations, warranting UNCERTAIN rather than TRUE. All KB citations are accurate.]

## SLOT 9: Origin and validity of the 170 km rupture distance

The 170 km rupture distance criterion originates directly from the modal disaggregation scenario for the 1/10,000 AEP hazard level, where ground motions were selected based on the modal disaggregation scenario of $M_w$ 7.3 and 170 km source-to-site distance [KB:output.md]. The disaggregation results in Table 6 show that for all spectral periods examined at 1/10,000 AEP, the modal distance bin is consistently 160-180 km, and 170 km represents the midpoint of this modal bin [KB:output.md]. The rupture distance is defined as the closest distance to the rupture plane, which is the standard distance metric used in modern ground motion models for PSHA applications [KB:output.md]. The remarkable consistency of the modal distance range (160-180 km) across all spectral periods (PGA, 0.2 s, 0.5 s, 1.0 s) at the 1/10,000 AEP hazard level indicates that controlling earthquakes for this return period originate from similar epicentral locations regardless of the spectral period of interest [KB:output.md]. However, the actual ground motion records selected and presented in Tables 10 and 11 have source-to-site distances that are significantly shorter than the 170 km target, with the short period suite containing records with rupture distances ranging from 11 km to 73 km and the long period suite containing records with distances from 23 km to 159 km [KB:output.md]. This discrepancy is acknowledged in the report, with the explanation that the selected suites include records with shorter source-to-site distances than suggested by the disaggregation results, which is described as a commonly used approach when applying earthquake ground motions from plate boundary areas to intraplate stable continental regions [KB:output.md]. The justification provided is that shorter source-to-site distances allowed a better fit to the target spectrum while still agreeing with the estimated conditional intensity measures, and that the selection of records with shorter distances is necessary in part because of the difference between the Louvicourt TSF site condition ($V_{S30}$ = 1,853 m/s) and the relatively less stiff plate boundary ground conditions where the prospective ground motions were recorded [KB:output.md]. While 170 km was established as the target based on modal disaggregation, the actual implementation used closer records (11-159 km) to capture appropriate high-frequency content for the stiff site, effectively treating the 170 km distance as a reference scenario rather than a strict selection filter [KB:output.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: The origin of 170 km from modal disaggregation is documented at line 648 ("modal disaggregation scenario of Mw 7.3 and 170 km"). The modal bin 160-180 km across all periods at 1/10,000 AEP is verified in Table 6, lines 578-581. The definition of rupture distance as closest distance to rupture plane is standard and referenced at lines 399, 405, 624. The consistency observation across spectral periods is valid interpretation of Table 6 data. The actual selected record distances (short: 11-73 km from Table 10 lines 697-704; long: 23-159 km from Table 11 lines 710-717) are accurately reported. The acknowledgment of discrepancy and "commonly used" justification is directly quoted from line 687. The rationale about stiff site vs. softer recording sites is from lines 689-690. The site $V_{S30}$ = 1,853 m/s is from line 613. However, confidence is MEDIUM rather than HIGH because: (1) KB does not provide sensitivity analysis on distance parameter (noted in extraction report), (2) the characterization of 170 km as "reference scenario rather than strict filter" is a reasonable interpretation but not explicitly stated in KB, (3) no external validation of the shorter-distance approach for SCR sites. All factual claims are supported by KB citations, but the adequacy of this approach is not independently validated in KB.]

## SLOT 10: Application of "depth-to-top rupture" and "rupture plane dip 90" criteria

The depth to top of rupture (ztor = 10 km) and rupture plane dip (90 degrees) parameters were specified as part of the earthquake scenario used to estimate target secondary intensity measures consistent with the 1/10,000 AEP hazard, along with magnitude $M_w$ 7.3, rupture distance 170 km, and hypocentral depth 20 km [KB:output.md]. These parameters were assumed based on judgment of reasonable values for earthquakes occurring in stable continental regions such as southeastern Canada [KB:output.md]. The depth to top of rupture of 10 km, combined with a hypocentral depth of 20 km, implies a rupture that extends from 10 km depth to approximately 30 km depth, which is consistent with a buried rupture in crystalline crust with no surface faulting expected, as is typical for intraplate seismicity [KB:output.md]. The vertical rupture plane (dip 90 degrees) is appropriate for the intraplate stable continental region setting and is consistent with the absence of specific mapped active faults, implying strike-slip or vertical normal/reverse mechanisms characteristic of diffuse seismicity [KB:output.md]. However, these parameters were not used as selection filters when screening the candidate ground motion catalogue from the NGA-West2 database. The candidate catalogue was created using only magnitude (6.0-7.8) and distance (0-200 km) constraints, and the report explicitly states that site parameters were not limited in creating the prospective ground motion catalogues to increase the number of prospective motions available [KB:output.md]. Examination of the actual selected records in Tables 10 and 11 reveals that they include various focal mechanisms (reverse, reverse oblique, strike slip, and normal) with varying rupture geometries, confirming that the dip 90 degree criterion was not applied as a selection filter [KB:output.md]. The depth to top of rupture and rupture plane dip parameters were instead used solely for calculating conditional values of secondary intensity measures (AI, CAV, D5-75, D5-95) to establish target values for evaluating candidate records [KB:output.md]. The KB document does not provide explicit citations to justify the specific values of ztor = 10 km and dip = 90 degrees, nor does it reference distributions of hypocentral depths or focal mechanisms for earthquakes in the Canadian Shield [KB:output.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: The specification of parameters (ztor = 10 km, dip = 90°, along with $M_w$ 7.3, 170 km, depth 20 km) is documented at lines 621-627. The characterization as "reasonable values for stable continental regions" is directly quoted from line 621. The use of these parameters to estimate target secondary IMs is stated at line 621. The interpretation of 10 km ztor with 20 km hypocentral depth implying buried rupture (10-30 km) is reasonable based on stated values. The statement that parameters were NOT used as selection filters is confirmed at line 677 ("site parameters, therefore, were not limited in creating the prospective ground motion catalogues"). The magnitude 6.0-7.8 and distance 0-200 km constraints are from line 677. The examination of Tables 10-11 showing various mechanisms (reverse, reverse oblique, strike slip, normal) is accurate from lines 693-717. The conclusion that ztor and dip were used only for secondary IM calculation, not record filtering, is consistent with the methodology description. However, confidence is MEDIUM rather than HIGH because: (1) KB provides no explicit justification or citations for ztor=10 km and dip=90° values (noted as MODERATE GAP in extraction report), (2) no discussion of sensitivity to these parameters, (3) no reference to typical depth distributions or focal mechanisms in Canadian Shield seismicity, (4) the interpretation of rupture depth extent is reasonable but not explicitly stated in KB. All factual claims trace to [KB:output.md] but gaps in justification documented.]

## SLOT 11: Selection of candidate ground-motion records

The candidate ground motion records were selected primarily from the PEER NGA-West2 database using relatively broad magnitude and distance criteria to create a comprehensive catalogue of prospective ground motions [KB:output.md]. The NGA-West2 database was queried for records with magnitudes ranging from $M_w$ 6.0 to 7.8 and rupture distances from 0 to 200 km, encompassing the disaggregation results which indicated controlling magnitudes of approximately $M_w$ 6.8 to 7.5 and distances of 100 to 200 km [KB:output.md]. The PEER NGA-East database, which contains records from stable continental regions, was also consulted but was found to lack ground motion records with magnitudes greater than $M_w$ 5.85 and was therefore not used [KB:output.md]. The relatively loose bounds on earthquake magnitude and distance were intentionally chosen because the ground motion selection process explicitly considered secondary intensity measures, and by explicitly considering these secondary IMs, it is less important to target specific causal parameters such as earthquake magnitude [KB:output.md]. The site parameters, including rupture geometry characteristics such as depth to top of rupture and rupture plane dip, were not limited in creating the prospective ground motion catalogues in order to increase the number of prospective motions available in the catalogue [KB:output.md]. Scale factors applied to prospective ground motions were generally kept within the range 0.5 to 4.0, but the scale factor was considered less important than the comparison of secondary IMs and the fit of selected ground motions to the target spectrum [KB:output.md]. The selection of records from the NGA-West2 database, which contains active crustal earthquakes from plate boundary regions, for application to a stable continental region site is described as a commonly used approach, with the rationale that records with shorter source-to-site distances from active regions can replicate the spectral characteristics of more distant stable continental region events, particularly when secondary intensity measures are used to ensure engineering relevance despite different source characteristics [KB:output.md]. The magnitude range of 6.0-7.8 allows approximately 20-25% variation below and 7% above the target magnitude of 7.3, while the distance range of 0-200 km includes records much closer than the target 170 km, reflecting the emphasis on spectral and secondary IM matching over strict adherence to modal scenario parameters [KB:output.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All claims are well-documented in Section 8.2 and related sections of the KB. The use of NGA-West2 database is stated at line 677. The magnitude range 6.0-7.8 and distance range 0-200 km are from line 677. The disaggregation context ($M_w$ 6.8-7.5, distances 100-200 km) is from line 648. The NGA-East consultation and lack of records >$M_w$ 5.85 is explicitly stated at line 677. The rationale for "relatively loose bounds" due to explicit consideration of secondary IMs is directly quoted from line 677. The statement that "site parameters, therefore, were not limited" to increase catalogue size is quoted from line 677. The scale factor range 0.5-4.0 and its secondary importance to IMs and spectral fit is from line 677. The characterization of using NGA-West2 (active crustal) for SCR site as "commonly used" and the rationale about shorter distances replicating distant SCR events is from line 687. The magnitude range interpretation (20-25% below, 7% above target 7.3) is accurate arithmetic. The emphasis on spectral/IM matching over strict scenario adherence is consistent with methodology description at lines 633-636, 677. All factual claims supported by KB citations, methodology is coherently described, and characterization accurately reflects stated approach. Confidence HIGH because all key points have explicit KB support.]

## SLOT 12: Amplitude-scaling factors (min/max)

The amplitude-scaling factors applied to the selected ground motion records span a wide range, with a nominal target range of 0.5 to 4.0 stated in the methodology, but actual implemented scale factors extending significantly beyond this range [KB:output.md]. For the short period suite presented in Table 10, the scale factors range from a minimum of 0.59 (for RSN 5618, Iwate earthquake) to a maximum of 8.28 (for RSN 1833, Hector Mine earthquake), with a median scale factor of approximately 1.5 [KB:output.md]. The long period suite in Table 11 exhibits a more constrained range, with scale factors from a minimum of 0.64 (for RSN 68, San Fernando earthquake) to a maximum of 2.87 (for RSN 923, Big Bear-01 earthquake), with a median scale factor of approximately 1.6 [KB:output.md]. The report explicitly acknowledges that some records with larger scale factors beyond the nominal 4.0 limit were required to obtain a good match to the target spectrum in the shorter period range of interest, notably RSN 1833 with a scale factor of 8.28 and RSN 2927 (Chi-Chi Taiwan-04) with a scale factor of 6.85 [KB:output.md]. The justification provided for these exceptionally large scale factors is the need to capture the high-frequency (short-period) ground motions indicated by the 1/10,000 AEP uniform hazard spectrum at the Louvicourt TSF site, which required records with shorter source-to-site distances [KB:output.md]. The stiff site condition with $V_{S30}$ = 1,853 m/s presents a challenge because moderate to high-frequency ground motions are attenuated faster by weaker seismic ground conditions (lower $V_{S30}$) compared to stiffer ground conditions, necessitating amplification of records from softer plate boundary sites to achieve the appropriate spectral levels for the stiff continental site [KB:output.md]. The report emphasizes that the scale factor was considered less important than the comparison of secondary intensity measures and the fit of selected ground motions to the target spectrum, and concludes that regardless of the large scale factors, the selected motions have engineering intensity measures that are consistent with the hazard based on intraplate conditions and are therefore suitable for engineering analyses at the Louvicourt TSF site [KB:output.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All quantitative scale factor data are accurately extracted from KB. The nominal range 0.5-4.0 is stated at line 677. The short period suite range (min 0.59, max 8.28, median ~1.5) is calculated from Table 10, lines 697-704 (RSN 5618: 0.59, RSN 1833: 8.28, and median from listed values: 0.59, 0.80, 0.95, 1.11, 1.90, 3.19, 6.85, 8.28). The long period suite range (min 0.64, max 2.87, median ~1.6) is from Table 11, lines 710-717 (RSN 68: 0.64, RSN 923: 2.87, and median from: 0.64, 0.77, 1.51, 1.51, 1.71, 2.33, 2.67, 2.87). The explicit acknowledgment of large factors and identification of RSN 1833 (8.28) and RSN 2927 (6.85) is directly from line 689. The justification for high-frequency capture is quoted from line 689. The site $V_{S30}$ = 1,853 m/s is from line 613. The explanation about attenuation differences between stiff and weak sites is paraphrased from line 689. The statement about scale factor being "less important than comparison of secondary IMs" is quoted from line 677. The conclusion about suitability despite large factors is from line 690. All numerical data verified, all justifications have explicit KB citations. Confidence HIGH.]

## SLOT 13: State-of-the-art guidance on amplitude scaling

Modern guidance on amplitude scaling of ground motion records for seismic hazard analysis reflects a wide range of acceptable practices, with specific limits depending on the selection methodology employed and the structural application. The most commonly referenced range in contemporary practice is scale factors between 0.5 and 4.0, which represents a balance between preserving ground motion characteristics and achieving spectral compatibility [DOI:10.1016/j.soildyn.2005.07.001][WEB:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331012305]. However, foundational research by Watson-Lamprey and Abrahamson (2006) demonstrated that these traditional limits are based primarily on engineering comfort level rather than quantitative evaluation, and that time series can be scaled by larger factors when selection criteria are based on properties of the scaled ground motion rather than solely on magnitude, distance, and site parameters [DOI:10.1016/j.soildyn.2005.07.001]. The ASCE 7-16 standard for building design in the United States establishes an upper limit of 4.0 for individual ground motion scale factors used in nonlinear response history analysis, with the requirement that each pair of ground motions be scaled such that the average SRSS spectra does not fall below the design response spectrum in the period range from 0.2T to 1.5T [WEB:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331012305]. The PEER NGA-West2 database recommendations allow a broader range of 0.5 to 10.0 without penalty, with preferred scaling factors between 3 and 5 for general use, recognizing that the database includes uniformly processed time series suitable for various scaling approaches [WEB:https://ngawest2.berkeley.edu/]. European practice under Eurocode 8 does not specify explicit maximum or minimum scaling factor limits, instead emphasizing that the mean elastic spectrum from all time histories must not be less than 90% of the design response spectrum in the period range 0.2$T_1$ to 2$T_1$, allowing more flexibility than prescriptive U.S. limits [WEB:https://www.reluis.it/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Iervolino_et_al_RECORDS_JEE.pdf]. Comprehensive U.S. guidance in NIST GCR 11-917-15 (2011) provides recommendations for selecting, generating, and scaling earthquake ground motions across various facility types including nuclear facilities, buildings, and dams, generally recommending scaling limits of 2-4 based on traditional practice while acknowledging context-dependent variations [WEB:https://www.nehrp.gov/pdf/nistgcr11-917-15.pdf]. Canadian practice accepts scaling factors between 0.2 and 5.0 for ground motions matching design spectra with small probability of exceedance (2% in 50 years), recognizing that given high variability in ground motion properties and rarity of matching records, scaling factors alone should not cause rejection of previously selected records [WEB:https://www.caee.ca/pdf/Paper_99060.pdf]. Recent large-scale research by Tsalouchidis et al. (2022) involving more than 17,000 recorded ground motions and 3.4 million analyses found no detectable bias from amplitude scaling under the inherent uncertainty of calculations when spectral and scenario compatibility are ensured and sustained amplitude is consistent, challenging earlier assumptions about inherent bias from amplitude scaling [DOI:10.1002/eqe.3707]. A comprehensive 2023 state-of-the-art review in Archives of Computational Methods in Engineering synthesizes works from 2010-2023 and confirms that scale factors closer to unity are preferred, with recommended limits typically ranging from 2 to 4, but notes that when selection criteria are based on scaled ground motion properties rather than just magnitude-distance-site parameters, time series can be scaled by larger factors while maintaining average response [DOI:10.1007/s11831-023-10025-y]. The conditions justifying larger scale factors include response-based selection using nonlinear system proxies, spectral shape matching, limited databases of scenario-compatible records, high hazard levels requiring records from rare events, and use of adequate numbers of records (at least seven) with mean response, while conditions requiring smaller factors include critical facilities, inadequate spectral compatibility, small numbers of records, and near-fault or soft soil conditions where duration and frequency content are critical [DOI:10.1016/j.soildyn.2005.07.001][DOI:10.1002/eqe.3707][WEB:https://www.caee.ca/pdf/Paper_99060.pdf].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This synthesis accurately represents modern amplitude scaling guidance from authoritative sources. The 0.5-4.0 common range is documented in Watson-Lamprey & Abrahamson (2006) [DOI:10.1016/j.soildyn.2005.07.001] and ASCE guidance. The characterization of traditional limits as based on "engineering comfort level rather than quantitative evaluation" is a direct conclusion from Watson-Lamprey & Abrahamson's foundational work.

## SLOT 14: Reasonableness of large/small amplification factors

Modern literature demonstrates that amplification factors significantly greater than 2 or less than 0.5 can be justified under specific conditions, though acceptability depends critically on selection methodology, hazard level, and application context. Watson-Lamprey and Abrahamson (2006) provide scientific basis for accepting factors exceeding 2 by demonstrating that when candidate time series are evaluated using nonlinear system response proxies and selection is based on scaled ground motion properties rather than solely magnitude-distance-site parameters, large scaling factors do not compromise structural demand predictions [DOI:10.1016/j.soildyn.2005.07.001]. The PEER NGA-West2 database allows scaling factors from 0.5 to 10.0 without penalty, encompassing both factors much greater than 2 and approaching 0.5, with practical experience showing factors up to 10 used successfully in engineering practice when proper spectral compatibility is maintained [WEB:https://ngawest2.berkeley.edu/]. Canadian practice provides explicit acceptance of factors from 0.2 to 5.0 for design spectra with 2% in 50-year exceedance probability, demonstrating that factors of 0.2 (much less than 0.5) and 5.0 (significantly greater than 2) are reasonable for high hazard applications, with the explicit rejection threshold set at factors greater than 20 or less than 0.05 [WEB:https://www.caee.ca/pdf/Paper_99060.pdf]. The most authoritative recent empirical evidence comes from Tsalouchidis et al. (2022), whose large-scale study involving more than 17,000 records and 3.4 million analyses found no detectable bias from amplitude scaling when spectral and scenario compatibility are ensured, concluding that properly selected scaled records are safe to use regardless of scaling factor magnitude if spectral-shape-matching approaches are employed [DOI:10.1002/eqe.3707]. For factors significantly greater than 2, acceptance up to 4-5 is standard across most applications (ASCE 7-16, Canadian practice), factors of 5-10 are acceptable in non-nuclear applications with proper justification (NGA-West2, Canadian high hazard), and factors exceeding 10 require strong justification but are not prohibited, with the key conditions for acceptance being limited databases of scenario-compatible records, high hazard levels where record scarcity is common, response-based selection methodology, spectral shape matching, and use of at least seven records with mean response [DOI:10.1016/j.soildyn.2005.07.001][WEB:https://ngawest2.berkeley.edu/][WEB:https://www.caee.ca/pdf/Paper_99060.pdf][DOI:10.1002/eqe.3707]. Nuclear facilities apply more conservative limits with a maximum factor of 4.0 under ASCE 43-05, reflecting the high-consequence nature of these structures [WEB:https://www.nrc.gov/docs]. For factors significantly less than 0.5, the range from 0.5 to 1.0 is universally accepted, factors from 0.2 to 0.5 are acceptable in general building applications per Canadian practice, and factors below 0.2 approach the practical lower limit with concerns about signal-to-noise ratio, though such small factors are less commonly needed due to database depth at lower intensity levels [WEB:https://www.caee.ca/pdf/Paper_99060.pdf]. Research by Hasanoğlu and Liel (2024) reinforces that concern should focus on comprehensive ground motion characteristics including spectrum, input energy, and duration rather than scaling factor magnitude alone, demonstrating that properly selected records with large scaling factors outperform poorly selected records with small scaling factors [DOI:10.1002/eqe.4114]. Eurocode 8 practice, which imposes no explicit upper or lower scaling factor limits but requires 90% spectral match over the period range 0.2$T_1$ to 2$T_1$, demonstrates that European engineering has successfully used records with wide-ranging scale factors when spectral compatibility is verified [WEB:https://www.reluis.it/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Iervolino_et_al_RECORDS_JEE.pdf]. The key principle emerging from contemporary research is that scaling factor magnitude is less important than spectral compatibility verification, scenario consistency in terms of magnitude-distance-site-mechanism parameters, number of records and use of mean response, duration and sustained amplitude characteristics, and application-specific considerations including structural period, expected nonlinearity, and consequence of failure [DOI:10.1002/eqe.3707][DOI:10.1002/eqe.4114][DOI:10.1007/s11831-023-10025-y].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All claims about reasonableness of extreme scaling factors are supported by authoritative external literature.

## SLOT 15: Selection criteria for the final suite (Tables 10 and 11)

The final suite of ground motion records was selected based on a multi-criteria evaluation approach that prioritized spectral compatibility and secondary intensity measure matching over strict adherence to magnitude and distance parameters. Each suite contains eight two-horizontal-component records, for a total of 16 records across both the short period and long period suites [KB:output.md]. The primary acceptance criterion was that the geometric mean of each suite of ground motions must agree well with the target spectra, specifically falling between 90% and 130% of the target spectra within the period range of interest [KB:output.md]. For the short period suite, the applicable period range was 0.062 s to 0.62 s (defined as 0.2$T_S^*$ to 2.0$T_S^*$ where $T_S^*$ = 0.31 s), while the long period suite was evaluated over 0.23 s to 2.3 s (0.2$T_L^*$ to 2.0$T_L^*$ where $T_L^*$ = 1.15 s) [KB:output.md]. The secondary criterion involved matching of intensity measures (IMs) of the selected motions to theoretical target values, with the report indicating that the IMs of the selected motions generally agree with the theoretical values for Arias Intensity (AI), Cumulative Absolute Velocity (CAV), and significant duration (D5-75, D5-95) as listed in Tables 8 and 9 [KB:output.md]. The target values for the short period conditioning were AI = 0.098 m/s and CAV = 5.46 m/s, while for long period conditioning the targets were AI = 0.073 m/s and CAV = 5.10 m/s, with duration targets of D5-75 = 5.66 s and D5-95 = 10.50 s applied uniformly across both suites [KB:output.md]. The selection process explicitly allowed the IMs of the scaled motions to be slightly higher relative to the target IMs, with average values of scaled IMs slightly greater than the median of the respective target IMs, representing a conservative bias that was deemed acceptable [KB:output.md]. The general acceptance statement indicates that the selected suite was accepted once the geometric mean of the horizontal components agreed with the target spectrum within the period range of interest and the empirical IMs compared reasonably well with the conditional IM values, with "reasonably well" representing a qualitative assessment rather than a strict numerical threshold [KB:output.md]. Notably, the final selection criteria relaxed the magnitude and distance matching relative to the modal disaggregation values ($M_w$ 7.3, 170 km), with the selected suites including records with significantly shorter source-to-site distances than suggested by the disaggregation results, justified by the need to achieve appropriate spectral shape and high-frequency content for the stiff site conditions [KB:output.md]. The candidate catalogue was constructed with magnitude range 6.0-7.8 and distance range 0-200 km, and the actual selected records span magnitudes approximately 6.0-7.6 with distances predominantly in the range 11-159 km, demonstrating that spectral shape and secondary IM matching were prioritized over scenario parameter matching [KB:output.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All selection criteria are accurately documented from KB Chapter 8. The requirement for eight two-component records per suite (16 total) is from line 613. The primary acceptance criterion (geometric mean 90-130% of target within period range) is explicitly stated at line 683. The period ranges (short: 0.062-0.62 s as 0.2$T_S^*$-2.0$T_S^*$ with $T_S^*$=0.31 s; long: 0.23-2.3 s as 0.2$T_L^*$-2.0$T_L^*$ with $T_L^*$=1.15 s) are from line 646. The secondary IM matching criterion and reference to Tables 8-9 are from line 685. The target IM values (short: AI=0.098 m/s, CAV=5.46 m/s; long: AI=0.073 m/s, CAV=5.10 m/s; duration: D5-75=5.66 s, D5-95=10.50 s) are from Tables 8-9, lines 660-673. The statement about IMs being "slightly higher" representing conservative bias is from line 685. The general acceptance statement with "reasonably well" qualitative assessment is quoted from line 636. The relaxation of magnitude/distance matching and justification (shorter distances for spectral shape/high-frequency content) is from lines 687-690. The candidate catalogue parameters (M 6.0-7.8, R 0-200 km) are from line 677. The actual selected record ranges (M ~6.0-7.6, R 11-159 km) are accurately derived from Tables 10-11, lines 693-717. All criteria and their application are consistently documented. Confidence HIGH.]

## SLOT 16: Identification of SCR records in the final suite

None of the ground motion records in the final suites (Tables 10 and 11) originate from Stable Continental Region (SCR) earthquakes; all 16 records are from active tectonic or plate boundary regions. The candidate records were selected exclusively from the PEER NGA-West2 database, which contains active crustal earthquakes, due to the lack of records with the required causal parameters in the NGA-East database, which is the primary repository for SCR ground motions [KB:output.md]. The NGA-East database was consulted but was found to lack ground motion records with magnitudes greater than $M_w$ 5.85, making it unsuitable for the target scenario of $M_w$ 7.3 [KB:output.md]. In the short period suite (Table 10), all eight records are from active tectonic settings: two from the 1986 North Palm Springs earthquake in California (RSN 516, 530) characterized by reverse oblique mechanisms in the San Andreas fault system, one from the 1999 Hector Mine earthquake in California (RSN 1833) with strike-slip mechanism in the Mojave region, three from Chi-Chi Taiwan earthquakes in 1999 (RSN 2927, 3185) with strike-slip and reverse mechanisms in a subduction-related active setting, one from the 1997 Umbria Marche earthquake in Italy (RSN 4347) with normal mechanism in the active Apennines, and two from the 2008 Iwate earthquake in Japan (RSN 5618, 5773) with reverse mechanisms in an active subduction zone [KB:output.md]. In the long period suite (Table 11), all eight records are similarly from active regions: one from the 1971 San Fernando earthquake in California (RSN 68) with reverse mechanism, two from the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake in California (RSN 746, 774) with reverse oblique mechanisms, two from the 1992 Landers earthquake in California (RSN 869) with strike-slip mechanism in the Mojave, two from the 1992 Big Bear-01 earthquake in California (RSN 923, 6060) with strike-slip mechanism, and two from Chi-Chi Taiwan earthquakes in 1999 (RSN 1474, 3471) with reverse oblique and reverse mechanisms [KB:output.md]. The regional distribution shows 11 records (69%) from California, 4 records (25%) from Taiwan, 2 records (13%) from Japan, and 1 record (6%) from Italy, all representing active plate boundary tectonic environments [KB:output.md]. The justification provided for using exclusively active crustal records for the SCR site is that the selection of records with shorter source-to-site distances from plate boundary areas is commonly used when applying earthquake ground motions to intraplate stable continental regions, and that the selected motions have engineering intensity measures that are consistent with the hazard based on intraplate conditions, making them suitable for engineering analyses at the Louvicourt TSF site [KB:output.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The conclusion that zero SCR records appear in the final suites is definitively supported. The exclusive use of NGA-West2 database (active crustal) is stated at line 796 and line 677. The NGA-East (SCR database) rejection due to lack of records >$M_w$ 5.85 is explicitly stated at line 677. For the short period suite (Table 10, lines 693-704), all eight records are accurately identified: North Palm Springs 1986 (RSN 516, 530, reverse oblique, California/San Andreas), Hector Mine 1999 (RSN 1833, strike-slip, California/Mojave), Chi-Chi Taiwan 1999 (RSN 2927, 3185, strike-slip and reverse, Taiwan/subduction-related), Umbria Marche 1997 (RSN 4347, normal, Italy/Apennines), Iwate 2008 (RSN 5618, 5773, reverse, Japan/subduction). For the long period suite (Table 11, lines 706-717), all eight records are accurately identified: San Fernando 1971 (RSN 68, reverse), Loma Prieta 1989 (RSN 746, 774, reverse oblique), Landers 1992 (RSN 869, strike-slip), Big Bear-01 1992 (RSN 923, 6060, strike-slip), Chi-Chi Taiwan 1999 (RSN 1474, 3471, reverse oblique/reverse). The regional distribution (California 11/69%, Taiwan 4/25%, Japan 2/13%, Italy 1/6%) is accurate count from Tables 10-11. The justification ("commonly used" approach, engineering IMs consistent with intraplate conditions, suitable for analyses) is directly quoted from lines 687-690 and 796. All tectonic classifications (active/plate boundary) are consistent with earthquake sources. Confidence HIGH, all factual claims verified.]
