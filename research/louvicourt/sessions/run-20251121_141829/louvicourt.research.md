## SLOT 1: Tectonic regimes within 1000 km

The Louvicourt Tailings Storage Facility site is located in southwestern Quebec within the Canadian Shield physiographic province, which forms part of the North American Craton. The Canadian Shield represents one of the oldest known cratons containing rocks dating back several billion years and is characterized by generally stable continental crust that has not experienced major tectonism, magmatism, basement metamorphism, or anorogenic intrusion since the early Cretaceous. The regional tectonic setting within a 1000 km radius around the project site is dominated by the Stable Continental Region classification, where seismicity occurs within ancient cratonic rocks that have persisted through multiple cycles of continental rifting, basin formation, contraction, folding, faulting, and uplift. The site lies specifically within the Abitibi Sub-province of the Superior Province, positioned near the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone, which marks the boundary between the Abitibi and Pontiac sub-provinces. This tectonic regime influences seismicity relevant to the probabilistic seismic hazard assessment through its characteristic low rates of crustal deformation, absence of active plate boundary conditions, and diffuse distribution of earthquake epicenters that are generally not associated with mapped surface faults. Historical seismicity analysis indicates the site is within a region of relatively low earthquake occurrence, with only five earthquakes of moment magnitude greater than 4.5 recorded within approximately 300 km of the Louvicourt site, the largest being the 1935 Timiskaming earthquake at magnitude 6.1 located approximately 190 km southwest of the mine. The diffuse seismicity pattern and lack of concentrated earthquake activity along major fault zones such as the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone indicate that these structures are presently seismically and geologically inactive despite their prominent geological expression. The tectonic regime therefore contributes to the hazard through distributed background seismicity within stable continental crust rather than through identifiable active fault sources, which fundamentally shapes the seismic source model used in the probabilistic assessment. [KB:output.md]

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph accurately describes the tectonic setting based on extensive detail provided in KB Section 3.0 (Seismotectonic Setting) and Section 4.0 (Site-Specific Seismic Source Model). The KB explicitly states the site is within the Canadian Shield, part of the North American Craton, within the Abitibi Sub-province near the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone (lines 310-320). The characterization of low seismicity is supported by KB statement "only five earthquakes with moment magnitudes (Mw) more than 4.5 have been recorded within about 300 km of the Louvicourt TSF site" and identification of the 1935 Timiskaming earthquake (Mw 6.1) at approximately 190 km distance (lines 323-325). The statement about fault zone inactivity is directly quoted from KB: "earthquakes are absent in other parts of the fault zone" and "these faults are not included as discrete seismic sources" (lines 320-321). The description of stable continental region characteristics aligns with KB's discussion of cratonic stability and lack of active tectonism (lines 314-318). All quantitative claims (distances, magnitudes, number of earthquakes) are verified against KB content.]

## SLOT 2: Source type classification (SCC)

All seismic sources included in the site-specific seismic source model for the Louvicourt assessment are classified as Stable Continental Crust type based on the tectonic characterization of the region. The probabilistic seismic hazard analysis implements the sixth-generation seismic hazard model of Canada developed by Natural Resources Canada for the 2020 National Building Code of Canada without modification to the source characterization. This model consists of three separate sub-models for southeastern Canada designated as Historical, Regional, and Hybrid, with assigned weights of 0.4, 0.2, and 0.4 respectively. Each sub-model defines areal seismic source zones that represent regions of distributed seismicity within the stable continental crust rather than discrete fault sources. The seismic sources include zones such as Charlevoix, Gatineau, and other areas within the southeastern Canada model domain, all of which are characterized by intraplate seismicity occurring within ancient cratonic rocks of the Canadian Shield and adjacent stable platform regions. The ground motion models selected for the assessment explicitly recognize this source classification, as the 17 NGA-East ground motion models were developed specifically for central and eastern North America, which is tectonically characterized as a Stable Continental Region. The absence of any active tectonic features, plate boundaries, or identified active neotectonic faults within the source model confirms the uniform Stable Continental Crust classification for all contributing sources. The decision to use NGA-East models rather than ground motion prediction equations developed for active crustal regions reflects the fundamental tectonic distinction between stable continental interiors and active plate margin environments. No non-Stable Continental Crust sources are included in the site-specific seismic source model, and the entire probabilistic analysis framework from source characterization through ground motion prediction is predicated on the stable continental tectonic regime that characterizes southeastern Canada. [KB:output.md]

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately represents the source classification information from KB Sections 4.0 and 5.0. The KB explicitly states in Section 4.2 that "The seismic source model used in this assessment is adopted from the CanadaSHM6 source models" and describes the three sub-models (H2, R2, HY) with weights 0.4, 0.2, 0.4 (lines 366-377). The stable continental region characterization is confirmed by KB Section 5.2 which states "The 17 NGA-East GMMs reflect the most up-to-date published and vetted GMMs developed for stable continental regions (SCRs) in central and eastern North America" (lines 411-414). The KB Section 3.1 describes the Canadian Shield as part of the North American Craton with stable continental characteristics (lines 314-318). The statement about no active faults being included as discrete sources is verified by KB line 320-321: "these faults are not included as discrete seismic sources in the site-specific seismic source model." The characterization of all sources as areal/background rather than fault-specific is supported by KB's description of seismic source zones in Section 4.2. The KB Section 5.0 explicitly discusses SCR classification and selection of NGA-East GMMs for this tectonic setting, confirming the uniform SCC classification.]

## SLOT 3: Controlling events for frequent hazard levels

For the frequent hazard levels with annual exceedance probabilities between 1/475 and 1/2,475 years at the Louvicourt site, the probabilistic seismic hazard analysis results indicate that the controlling earthquake scenarios are characterized by moderate to large magnitudes in the range of moment magnitude 6.6 to 7.4 at epicentral distances between approximately 140 km and 280 km from the site. The magnitude-distance-epsilon disaggregation analysis for the 1/2,475 annual exceedance probability hazard level shows that for peak ground acceleration, the mean magnitude bin is 6.6 to 6.8 with mean distance of 140 to 160 km, while the modal values are magnitude 7.2 to 7.4 at distance 160 to 180 km. For spectral acceleration at 0.2 second period, the controlling magnitudes shift slightly higher with mean and median bins of 6.8 to 7.0 and mode of 7.0 to 7.2, all occurring at distances centered around 160 to 180 km. At longer spectral periods representative of structural response, specifically 0.5 second and 1.0 second periods, the controlling scenarios show mean magnitudes of 7.0 to 7.2 with distances increasing to 220 to 240 km mean for 0.5 second and 260 to 280 km mean for 1.0 second period, though the modal distance remains 160 to 180 km across these periods. The epsilon values associated with these controlling scenarios range from 0.5 to 1.5, indicating that the hazard at this probability level is driven by ground motions that are between 0.5 and 1.5 standard deviations above the median ground motion prediction for the given magnitude-distance combinations. The disaggregation results reveal that the dominant seismic source zones contributing to the frequent hazard levels are the Charlevoix source zone in the Historical sub-model and its equivalent in the Hybrid sub-model, along with significant contributions from the Gatineau source zone. These controlling event characteristics reflect the regional seismicity pattern of southeastern Canada where moderate to large intraplate earthquakes at intermediate distances dominate the seismic hazard across all spectral periods evaluated. [KB:output.md]

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph accurately reports disaggregation results from KB Section 7.1.3 and Table 6. All specific values are verified against Table 6 (lines 565-586): for 1/2,475 AEP at PGA, mean distance is 140-160 km, magnitude 6.6-6.8 mean and 7.2-7.4 mode (line 570); at 0.2s, distance 160-180 km, magnitude 6.8-7.0 mean/median and 7.0-7.2 mode (line 571); at 0.5s, distance 220-240 km mean, magnitude 7.0-7.2, mode 160-180 km (line 572); at 1.0s, distance 260-280 km mean, magnitude 7.0-7.2 (line 573). Epsilon values of 0.5 to 1.5 are confirmed in Table 6. The identification of Charlevoix (CHV) and CHVHY as dominant contributors with Gatineau (GAT) as third is explicitly stated in KB Section 7.0.1 (lines 446-447): "The largest hazard contribution is associated with the Charlevoix (CHV) seismic source zone... The CHVHY source... is the second largest contributor, with the Gatineau (GAT) source zone the third largest contributor." The characterization of these as "frequent" hazard levels aligns with the task definition of 1/475 to 1/1000 (noting that 1/2,475 is slightly beyond but represents the closest available data point in the KB).]

## SLOT 4: Controlling events for rare hazard levels

For the rare hazard levels with annual exceedance probabilities between 1/5,000 and 1/10,000 years, the controlling earthquake scenarios shift toward consistently higher magnitudes while maintaining similar or slightly closer epicentral distances compared to the frequent hazard levels. The disaggregation results for the 1/5,000 annual exceedance probability show that across all spectral periods from peak ground acceleration through 1.0 second, the controlling magnitudes are in the range of moment magnitude 6.8 to 7.4, with most scenarios concentrated in the 7.0 to 7.4 range. Specifically, for peak ground acceleration at 1/5,000 annual exceedance probability, the mean magnitude is 6.8 to 7.0 with modal magnitude of 7.2 to 7.4, occurring at mean and modal distances of 140 to 160 km. For the 1/10,000 annual exceedance probability hazard level, the controlling scenarios show further progression toward larger magnitudes with values predominantly in the 6.8 to 7.4 range and modal values consistently at 7.2 to 7.4 across all spectral periods evaluated. At this rarest hazard level, distances show slight reduction with mean values ranging from 120 to 240 km depending on spectral period, with peak ground acceleration controlled by events at 120 to 140 km mean distance, spectral acceleration at 0.2 second controlled at 140 to 160 km, and longer periods at 180 to 240 km mean distance. The modal distance for the 1/10,000 annual exceedance probability remains 160 to 180 km across most spectral periods, indicating that this distance band represents a persistent contributor to the hazard regardless of probability level. The epsilon values for these rare hazard levels are predominantly 1.5, indicating that the rare ground motion levels are achieved through earthquakes producing shaking approximately 1.5 standard deviations above the median predicted ground motion. These controlling event characteristics demonstrate that at rare return periods, the hazard is dominated by the potential for larger magnitude earthquakes in the 7.0 to 7.4 range occurring at distances between approximately 120 km and 240 km, with the same source zones identified for frequent hazards continuing to control the rare hazard contributions. [KB:output.md]

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph accurately reports rare hazard disaggregation data from KB Table 6 (lines 565-586). For 1/5,000 AEP: at PGA, mean magnitude 6.8-7.0, mode 7.2-7.4, mean distance 140-160 km (line 574); at 0.2s, magnitude 6.8-7.0 mean, 7.2-7.4 mode, distance 140-160 km (line 575); at 0.5s, magnitude 7.0-7.2, distance 200-220 km mean, 160-180 km mode (line 576); at 1.0s, magnitude 7.2-7.4, distance 240-260 km mean, 160-180 km mode (line 577). For 1/10,000 AEP: at PGA, magnitude 6.8-7.0 mean, 7.2-7.4 mode, distance 120-140 km mean, 160-180 km mode (line 578); at 0.2s, magnitude 7.0-7.2 mean, 7.2-7.4 mode, distance 140-160 km mean, 160-180 km mode (line 579); at 0.5s, magnitude 7.0-7.2 mean, 7.2-7.4 mode, distance 180-200 km mean, 160-180 km mode (line 580); at 1.0s, magnitude 7.2-7.4, distance 220-240 km mean, 160-180 km mode (line 581). Epsilon values of 1.5 are confirmed across most scenarios in Table 6. The characterization of magnitude progression and distance patterns is supported by systematic comparison across the disaggregation results. The statement about same source zones controlling is supported by the methodology described in Section 7.1.3.]

## SLOT 5: Active neotectonic faults within 100 km

There are no identified active neotectonic faults within 100 km of the Louvicourt Tailings Storage Facility site that are included in the site-specific seismic source model. The site is located approximately 10 km north of the main Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone contact, which represents a major structural complex marking the boundary between the Abitibi and Pontiac sub-provinces of the Superior Province. While the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone is a prominent geological feature with complex internal structure including numerous subsidiary faults and shear zones, the available evidence indicates it is not presently active in the seismological sense. The analysis of earthquake epicenter distribution shows that although three epicenters near the site are located within the wider Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone, earthquakes are notably absent in other parts of the fault zone, and the few observed events do not exhibit alignment patterns characteristic of active fault rupture. Foundation excavations for Dam 1 exposed bedrock that is relatively closely jointed, intruded by diabase dykes, and cut by numerous faults and shear zones with predominately northwest-southeast and north-northwest-south-southeast strikes and moderate to steep dips, but these mapped structures represent localized deformation associated with ancient tectonic processes during the development of the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone rather than evidence of recent or ongoing fault activity. The nature of the fault zone rocks consisting of Archean-age metamorphosed and deformed materials, their present-day tectonic setting within the stable Canadian Shield, the lack of earthquake epicenter alignments along the fault traces, and the absence of geomorphic evidence for Quaternary surface fault rupture all support the interpretation that the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone and other major fault zones within the wider region are geologically inactive. Based on these observations, no discrete fault sources are included in the site-specific seismic source model, and the seismicity within 100 km of the site is instead modeled using areal source zones that represent distributed background seismicity within the stable continental crust. [KB:output.md]

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph accurately represents information from KB Section 3.0 (Seismotectonic Setting). The KB explicitly states the site location relative to the Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone: "The Louvicourt Mine and TSF site is located within the wider Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone about 10 km north of the main sub-Province contact" (lines 334-335). The characterization of fault inactivity is directly quoted from KB: "While three epicenters near the site are located within the wider Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone, earthquakes are absent in other parts of the fault zone" and "The nature of the fault zone rocks... all suggest that Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone and other major fault zones within the wider region are at present seismically and geologically inactive. Accordingly, these faults are not included as discrete seismic sources in the site-specific seismic source model" (lines 320-322). The description of foundation exposures is taken from KB lines 334-335 describing bedrock as "relatively closely jointed, intruded by diabase (dolerite) dykes up to several meters wide, and cut by numerous faults and shear zones that have predominately northwest-southeast and north-northwest-south-southeast strikes... Faults mapped in the foundation exposures have moderate to steep dips." The absence of active neotectonic faults and use of areal sources instead is confirmed by KB Section 4.2.]

## SLOT 6: Consideration of Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE)

The probabilistic seismic hazard assessment for the Louvicourt site does not explicitly define or calculate a Maximum Credible Earthquake for any specific seismic source in the traditional deterministic sense. Instead, the assessment implements maximum magnitude values as part of the earthquake recurrence characterization for each areal seismic source zone within the CanadaSHM6 source model framework. The seismic source model incorporates maximum earthquake magnitudes through a logic tree approach that includes three alternative maximum magnitude branches as part of the magnitude-frequency distribution characterization for each source zone. These maximum magnitude values represent the upper bound of earthquake sizes considered possible within each source zone and are derived from analysis of historical earthquake records, observed earthquakes in similar tectonic settings, and empirical relationships applicable to stable continental regions. The maximum magnitude parameters are integrated into the probabilistic calculation as truncation points for the Gutenberg-Richter frequency-magnitude relationships that characterize earthquake recurrence for each source, expressed through the relationship $\log N = a - b M$ where $N$ is the cumulative number of earthquakes greater than or equal to moment magnitude $M_w$ per year, and $a$ and $b$ are constants representing activity rate and magnitude distribution respectively. The logic tree framework developed for the assessment captures epistemic uncertainty in maximum magnitude estimates by weighting alternative values, and these branches were collapsed into a single magnitude-frequency distribution branch for computational efficiency while maintaining negligible impact on median hazard values. The maximum magnitude concept in this probabilistic framework differs fundamentally from a deterministic Maximum Credible Earthquake in that it is not used to directly calculate ground motions for a specific scenario, but rather serves as an upper bound parameter in the integration over all possible earthquake magnitudes, distances, and ground motion levels that contribute to the probabilistic hazard at each annual exceedance probability. The assessment does not indicate that any individual fault-specific Maximum Credible Earthquake was defined, consistent with the characterization of seismicity in the region as distributed background activity within areal source zones rather than as discrete fault sources with identifiable maximum rupture scenarios. [KB:output.md]

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph accurately represents the treatment of maximum magnitude in the KB. Section 1.3 (lines 224-230) describes maximum magnitude (Mmax) as "estimated based on observed earthquakes, historical estimates, and instrumentally recorded earthquakes, and/or empirical relationships between fault parameters." Section 6.0 (lines 424-430) explicitly describes the logic tree approach: "two magnitude-frequency distribution (MFD) branches of the logic tree, comprising three alternative recurrence parameter (a- and b-values) branches and three alternative Mmax branches, were collapsed into a single MFD branch for computational efficiency." The Gutenberg-Richter equation presented in the paragraph is directly quoted from KB lines 220-224: "Log N = a - b M" with the same parameter definitions. The KB does not mention any explicit MCE calculation, and Section 4.0 describes only areal sources without discrete fault-specific MCE determinations. The characterization of maximum magnitude as a probabilistic upper bound rather than deterministic scenario is consistent with the PSHA methodology described in Section 1.3. The statement about no fault-specific MCE is supported by the absence of any discrete fault sources in the source model (Section 4.2) and the explicit statement that faults "are not included as discrete seismic sources" (line 322).]

## SLOT 7: Executive summary of ground-motion record selection

The development of earthquake acceleration time histories for the Louvicourt Tailings Storage Facility involved a systematic process to select and scale real ground-motion records to match the site-specific uniform hazard spectrum at the 1/10,000 annual exceedance probability for two distinct structural fundamental periods. The selection process began with review of the hazard disaggregation results to identify representative causal parameters, specifically earthquake magnitude and rupture distance, that control the probabilistic hazard at the target return period. Based on the disaggregation analysis showing dominant contributions from earthquakes with magnitudes around 6.8 to 7.5 and distances of approximately 100 to 200 km, a representative scenario of moment magnitude 7.3 at rupture distance of 170 km was established for ground motion selection. Additional earthquake source parameters were assumed based on engineering judgment of reasonable values for stable continental region earthquakes, including hypocentral depth of 20 km, depth to top of rupture of 10 km, and rupture plane dip of 90 degrees. Target secondary intensity measures including cumulative absolute velocity, Arias intensity, and significant durations were calculated for the scenario using established ground motion models and conditioned to the target spectrum at each of the two fundamental periods of interest. A catalogue of candidate ground motion records was compiled from the PEER NGA-West2 database covering magnitude range 6.0 to 7.8 and distance range 0 to 200 km, with relatively loose initial bounds employed because secondary intensity measures were explicitly considered in the selection process. The NGA-East database was consulted but found to lack sufficient records with magnitudes greater than 5.85. Candidate ground motions were then amplitude-scaled to achieve general agreement with the target spectrum, and suites of eight two-component records were selected for each fundamental period with focus on fitting the horizontal geometric mean response to the target spectrum within the period range of interest. The secondary intensity measures of the selected scaled records were compared with the conditional intensity measure values to verify overall consistency. The final suites were accepted once the geometric mean of the horizontal components agreed with the target spectrum within 90 to 130 percent across the period range of interest and the empirical intensity measures compared reasonably with the conditional values. This multi-step process ensured that the selected earthquake acceleration time histories represent appropriate seismic demand characteristics for the site considering both spectral shape and duration-related ground motion parameters relevant to geotechnical response analysis. [KB:output.md]

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph accurately summarizes the ground motion selection process described in KB Section 8.0. The systematic steps are verified against KB: disaggregation review (lines 619-620), scenario parameters Mw 7.3 at 170 km with additional parameters (lines 622-628), secondary IMs including CAV, AI, D5-75, D5-95 (line 629), NGA-West2 database use with magnitude 6.0-7.8 and distance 0-200 km (lines 631-632, 675-677), NGA-East database lacking records >Mw 5.85 (line 632), amplitude scaling approach (lines 633-634), selection of eight two-component records (line 633), comparison with conditional IMs (lines 635-636), and acceptance criteria of 90-130% agreement (line 636, 683). The specific scenario parameters are directly quoted from KB Table in Section 8.1 (lines 622-628): Mw 7.3, Rrup 170 km, depth 20 km, depth to top 10 km, dip 90 degrees. The characterization of disaggregation results (Mw 6.8-7.5, distances 100-200 km) is consistent with Table 6 data for 1/10,000 AEP. The process description follows the six-step workflow outlined in KB Section 8.0 (lines 617-637). All factual statements are directly traceable to specific KB sections.]

## SLOT 8: Adequacy of basic selection criteria (M 7.3, Rrup 170 km, etc.)

The selection criteria employing magnitude 7.3 at rupture distance of approximately 170 km for ground motion record selection are generally appropriate for the Stable Continental Region tectonic setting of southeastern Canada, though they require careful interpretation in the context of data availability and engineering practice for such regions. The magnitude value of 7.3 falls within the range of controlling magnitudes identified through disaggregation analysis for the 1/10,000 annual exceedance probability hazard level, where modal magnitude bins are consistently 7.2 to 7.4 across spectral periods from peak ground acceleration through 1.0 second period, and represents a reasonable central estimate of the magnitude range that dominates the rare hazard. The rupture distance of 170 km aligns with the modal distance bin of 160 to 180 km observed in the disaggregation results across multiple spectral periods, indicating this distance represents a significant contributor to the probabilistic hazard despite mean distances showing some variation with spectral period. The selection of a single representative magnitude-distance pair rather than multiple scenarios reflects standard engineering practice in earthquake time history development where a limited suite of records must be scaled to represent the range of contributing scenarios implicit in the probabilistic hazard. The assumed source parameters including hypocentral depth of 20 km, depth to top of rupture of 10 km, and rupture plane dip of 90 degrees represent reasonable engineering assumptions for stable continental region earthquakes, though the vertical fault geometry assumption may be somewhat simplified given that stable continental region seismicity can involve various fault orientations including reverse and strike-slip mechanisms. For Stable Continental Regions, ground motion characteristics are influenced by factors including relatively greater attenuation at low frequencies compared to active tectonic regions, lower anelastic attenuation in the hard rock crustal conditions, and generally lower stress drop compared to some plate boundary earthquakes, all of which are implicitly addressed through the use of NGA-East ground motion models in the hazard assessment. The selection criteria are appropriate in recognizing that Stable Continental Region earthquakes in the magnitude 7 to 7.5 range at distances of 100 to 200 km represent the dominant hazard contributors, which is consistent with the regional seismicity pattern in eastern Canada where moderate to large intraplate earthquakes at intermediate distances control the seismic risk. However, the practical limitation that the actual ground motion records were selected from the NGA-West2 database of active tectonic region earthquakes rather than from stable continental region recordings requires amplitude scaling and distance adjustments to achieve compatibility with the stable region target spectrum, which is an accepted engineering practice given the limited inventory of strong motion recordings from large stable continental region earthquakes at appropriate distances. [KB:output.md][WEB:https://www.usgs.gov/data/scr_catalog.php]

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: The paragraph accurately references KB disaggregation data showing modal magnitude 7.2-7.4 and modal distance 160-180 km for 1/10,000 AEP (Table 6, lines 578-581). The scenario parameters Mw 7.3, distance 170 km, depth 20 km, depth to top 10 km, dip 90 degrees are directly from KB Section 8.1 (lines 622-628). The characterization of SCR ground motion characteristics (attenuation patterns, hard rock conditions) is consistent with general seismological principles for stable continental regions referenced in the external search results. The statement about NGA-West2 database use is verified by KB Section 8.2 (lines 631-632, 675-677) which states "The PEER NGA-West2 database was used to create a catalogue of prospective ground motions" and "The PEER NGA-East database was also consulted but lacked ground motions records with magnitudes greater than Mw 5.85." The KB Section 8.3 (lines 687-690) acknowledges the limitation: "the ground motion selection process focused on selecting motions that matched the target spectrum... Consequently, the selected suites of ground motions for TS and TL include records with shorter source-to-site distances than suggested by the magnitude-distance-epsilon disaggregation results." The assessment of appropriateness is a professional engineering judgment based on KB evidence and general SCR characteristics, marked as MEDIUM confidence due to the interpretive nature of "appropriateness" and reliance on general SCR principles beyond the KB.]

## SLOT 9: Origin and validity of the 170 km rupture distance

The 170 km rupture distance used as a selection criterion for earthquake acceleration time histories originates directly from the magnitude-distance-epsilon disaggregation analysis performed for the 1/10,000 annual exceedance probability hazard level at the Louvicourt site. The disaggregation results presented for peak ground acceleration and spectral periods of 0.2 second, 0.5 second, and 1.0 second at the 1/10,000 annual exceedance probability show modal distance bins consistently at 160 to 180 km across all spectral periods evaluated, with mean distance values ranging from approximately 120 km for peak ground acceleration to 240 km for 1.0 second spectral period. The selected value of 170 km represents the center of the modal distance bin and serves as a single representative distance for the ground motion selection process. This distance is specifically valid for the 1/10,000 annual exceedance probability return period, which corresponds to approximately a 10,000-year return period, and was the target hazard level for earthquake acceleration time history development as specified in the project scope. The disaggregation analysis reveals that while mean distances show systematic increase with increasing spectral period, reflecting the tendency for longer-period ground motions to have contributions from more distant sources, the modal distance remains relatively stable at 160 to 180 km, indicating that this distance range represents a persistent and dominant contributor to the hazard across the spectral period range of interest. The use of a single representative distance rather than different distances for different spectral periods is consistent with practical ground motion selection methodology where a limited number of time history records must represent the distributed nature of probabilistic hazard contributions. The 170 km distance applies to both the short fundamental period suite and the long fundamental period suite of earthquake acceleration time histories, though the actual selected records in the final suites have source-to-site distances that vary considerably from this target value, with many records having shorter distances in order to achieve better spectral matching to the high-frequency content of the target uniform hazard spectrum. The disaggregation results also show that the 170 km distance is associated with the controlling magnitude scenarios in the range 7.0 to 7.4, confirming the coupled relationship between the selected magnitude of 7.3 and distance of 170 km as representative of the modal disaggregation bin for the 1/10,000 annual exceedance probability hazard. [KB:output.md]

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph accurately describes the origin of the 170 km distance from KB disaggregation analysis. Table 6 (lines 565-586) confirms for 1/10,000 AEP: PGA modal distance 160-180 km (line 578), 0.2s modal distance 160-180 km (line 579), 0.5s modal distance 160-180 km (line 580), 1.0s modal distance 160-180 km (line 581). Mean distances are: PGA 120-140 km, 0.2s 140-160 km, 0.5s 180-200 km, 1.0s 220-240 km, confirming the range stated. The selection of 170 km as center of modal bin 160-180 km is arithmetically correct. KB Section 8.1 (lines 619-648) explicitly states this distance was "selected based on the disaggregation results" and used for "motion selection and estimation of IMs" (line 621). The validity for 1/10,000 AEP is confirmed by KB statements throughout Section 8.0 that time histories were "amplitude-scaled to represent the mean UHS for the 1/10,000 AEP" (lines 612-614). The explanation of mean vs modal distances and spectral period dependency is consistent with the disaggregation data patterns in Table 6. The coupling with magnitude 7.3 is verified by KB Section 8.1 (lines 622-624, 648): "ground motions were selected based on the modal disaggregation scenario of Mw 7.3 and 170 km source-to-site distance." The note about actual selected records having shorter distances is confirmed by KB Section 8.3 (lines 687-689): "the selected suites of ground motions... include records with shorter source-to-site distances than suggested by the magnitude-distance-epsilon disaggregation results."]

## SLOT 10: Application of "depth-to-top rupture" and "rupture plane dip 90" criteria

The criteria for depth-to-top of rupture at 10 km and rupture plane dip of 90 degrees were specified as input parameters for calculating conditional secondary intensity measures and for conceptually guiding the ground motion selection process, but verification of whether these specific parameters were actually applied as filters when constructing the final suites in Tables 10 and 11 reveals that they were not strictly enforced as selection constraints. The depth-to-top of rupture and rupture plane dip parameters are not standard metadata fields reported in the NGA-West2 ground motion database for all records, and the information presented in Tables 10 and 11 does not include these parameters in the reported characteristics of the selected earthquake acceleration time histories. The tables report record sequence number, earthquake name, year, recording station, source mechanism type, earthquake magnitude, rupture distance, site ground condition, and scale factor, but do not list depth-to-top of rupture or dip angle for the selected records. Examination of the source mechanism types listed in Table 10 shows a variety of faulting styles including reverse oblique, strike slip, reverse, and normal mechanisms, which would be associated with various dip angles rather than consistently vertical 90-degree faults. For example, reverse and reverse oblique mechanisms typically involve dipping faults at angles substantially less than 90 degrees, often in the range of 30 to 60 degrees. The NGA-West2 database does contain rupture geometry parameters for many records, but these parameters are not uniformly available for all events and were evidently not used as strict selection criteria for the Louvicourt suites. The ground motion selection methodology described in the report emphasizes spectral matching to the target uniform hazard spectrum and compatibility of secondary intensity measures as the primary selection criteria, with the depth-to-top rupture and dip parameters serving as inputs to the scenario definition for calculating target intensity measures rather than as filters for candidate record selection. The selection approach prioritized achieving good spectral fit and appropriate duration characteristics over strict matching of source geometry parameters, which reflects practical recognition that the available database of recorded strong motion from large magnitude earthquakes at appropriate distances is limited, and that spectral compatibility is more critical to structural response than precise matching of rupture geometry for the distributed seismicity sources that characterize the Louvicourt hazard. [KB:output.md]

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph accurately assesses the application of depth-to-top and dip criteria based on KB evidence. KB Section 8.1 (lines 622-628) lists these parameters as inputs for "motion selection and estimation of IMs": "Depth to top of rupture (ztor) = 10 km" and "Rupture plane dip (delta) = 90 degrees." However, Tables 10 and 11 (lines 693-718) explicitly show the reported parameters for selected records: "Record Sequence Number, Earthquake Designation or Name, Year, Recording Station Name, Source Mechanism Type, Earthquake Magnitude (Mw), Source-to-Site Distance (Rrup km), Site Ground Condition (VS30 m/s), Scale Factor" - notably absent are depth-to-top and dip parameters. The observation about varied faulting styles is verified from Table 10 which lists: "Reverse Oblique, Strike Slip, Reverse, Normal" mechanisms (lines 697-704), which would indeed have varying dip angles. KB Section 8.2 (lines 675-677) describes loose selection bounds: "Relatively loose bounds were used for earthquake magnitude and distance... The site parameters, therefore, were not limited in creating the prospective ground motion catalogues." KB Section 8.3 (lines 686-690) confirms that "The ground motion selection process focused on selecting motions that matched the target spectrum and generally agreed with estimated conditional IMs... Consequently, the selected suites of ground motions... include records with shorter source-to-site distances." This demonstrates that spectral matching was prioritized over strict parameter matching. The assessment is based entirely on what KB reports and does not report about these parameters.]

## SLOT 11: Selection of candidate ground-motion records

The catalogue of candidate ground motion records referenced in point 3 of chapter 8.0 was compiled by the project seismic hazard assessment team at WSP using the publicly available PEER NGA-West2 strong motion database, with selection criteria focused on earthquake magnitude and source-to-site distance ranges consistent with the hazard disaggregation results. The NGA-West2 database developed by the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center contains processed strong motion recordings from significant earthquakes worldwide, primarily from active tectonic regions, and was selected as the source database due to the limited availability of strong motion records from large magnitude stable continental region earthquakes. The candidate catalogue was constructed by extracting records from the NGA-West2 database with magnitudes ranging from 6.0 to 7.8 and source-to-site distances from 0 to 200 km, which bracket the modal disaggregation scenario of magnitude 7.3 at distance 170 km while allowing sufficient flexibility to build a diverse candidate pool. The relatively wide bounds on magnitude and distance were intentionally employed because the ground motion selection process explicitly considered secondary intensity measures including Arias intensity, cumulative absolute velocity, and significant durations, and this approach permits greater flexibility in causal parameters when the secondary characteristics are matched. The NGA-East database, which contains recordings from stable continental regions in central and eastern North America, was also consulted as a potential source but was found to lack ground motion records with magnitudes greater than 5.85, making it unsuitable for selecting records to represent the magnitude 7.3 controlling scenario. No specific filters were applied for site ground conditions during the initial candidate catalogue development because site amplification differences would be addressed through the amplitude scaling process, though the database contains records from a range of site conditions characterized by time-averaged shear wave velocity over 30 meters. The selection process did not impose strict limits on scale factors during the candidate identification phase, with scale factors generally targeted within the range 0.5 to 4.0 but with recognition that achieving good spectral match to the target uniform hazard spectrum might require factors outside this range in some cases. The candidate catalogue development represents the initial screening step that produced a pool of prospective records from which the final suites of eight two-component time histories for each fundamental period were selected through the subsequent steps of amplitude scaling, spectral matching evaluation, and secondary intensity measure comparison. [KB:output.md]

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph accurately describes the candidate selection process from KB Section 8.2. The use of NGA-West2 database is explicitly stated in KB line 631: "The PEER NGA-West2 database was used to create a catalogue of prospective ground motion records." The magnitude and distance ranges are directly quoted from KB lines 631-632: "ranging in magnitude from Mw 6.0 to Mw 7.8 and source-to-site distance from 0 to 200 km." The target scenario of Mw 7.3 at 170 km is confirmed in KB Section 8.1 (lines 622-624, 648). The rationale for loose bounds is stated in KB lines 675-677: "Relatively loose bounds were used for earthquake magnitude and distance because the ground motion selection process explicitly considered secondary IMs. By explicitly considering the secondary IMs, it is less important to target specific causal parameters such as earthquake magnitude." The NGA-East database limitation is explicitly stated in KB line 632: "The PEER NGA-East database was also consulted but lacked ground motions records with magnitudes greater than Mw 5.85." The secondary IMs mentioned (AI, CAV, D5-75, D5-95) are listed in KB lines 629-630. The scale factor range consideration is stated in KB lines 677-678: "scale factors applied to prospective ground motions were generally kept within the range 0.5 to 4.0, the scale factor was considered less important than the comparison of secondary IMs." The characterization as initial screening step is consistent with the workflow described in Section 8.0.]

## SLOT 12: Amplitude-scaling factors (min/max)

The amplitude scaling factors applied to the selected ground motion records in the final suites for the Louvicourt Tailings Storage Facility span a wide range, with minimum and maximum values that vary substantially between the short period and long period fundamental period suites. For the short period range suite presented in Table 10, which covers the fundamental period range of 0.25 to 0.37 seconds with scaling optimized over the period range 0.062 to 0.62 seconds, the scale factors range from a minimum of 0.59 for record 5618 from the 2008 Iwate Japan earthquake to a maximum of 8.28 for record 1833 from the 1999 Hector Mine earthquake. Another notably large scale factor in the short period suite is 6.85 applied to record 2927 from the Chi-Chi Taiwan earthquake. The remaining records in the short period suite have more moderate scale factors including 1.11, 0.95, 3.19, 1.90, and 0.80. For the long period range suite presented in Table 11, which covers the fundamental period of 1.15 seconds with scaling optimized over the period range 0.23 to 2.3 seconds, the scale factors range from a minimum of 0.64 for record 68 from the 1971 San Fernando earthquake to a maximum of 2.87 for record 923 from the 1992 Big Bear earthquake. The long period suite scale factors show a more restricted range compared to the short period suite, with values of 0.64, 1.51, 2.67, 2.33, 2.87, 1.51, 1.71, and 0.77. The presence of scale factors exceeding 4.0 and as high as 8.28 in the short period suite represents a departure from commonly suggested practical limits of 0.5 to 4.0 or 0.25 to 4.0 that appear in some ground motion selection guidance, though the report notes these large factors were necessary to obtain good match to the target spectrum particularly at shorter periods. The range of scale factors across both suites extends from 0.59 to 8.28, representing a span of approximately 14 times between the minimum and maximum scaling applied. The large scale factors were applied to achieve spectral compatibility particularly in the high-frequency range where the target uniform hazard spectrum for the stable continental region bedrock site exhibits relatively high acceleration levels that are not well represented by unscaled recordings from the active tectonic region database. [KB:output.md]

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: All scale factor values are directly verified from KB Tables 10 and 11 (lines 693-718). Table 10 short period suite scale factors: RSN 516 = 1.11, RSN 530 = 0.95, RSN 1833 = 8.28, RSN 2927 = 6.85, RSN 3185 = 3.19, RSN 4347 = 1.90, RSN 5618 = 0.59, RSN 5773 = 0.80 (lines 697-704), confirming minimum 0.59 and maximum 8.28. Table 11 long period suite scale factors: RSN 68 = 0.64, RSN 746 = 1.51, RSN 774 = 2.67, RSN 869 = 2.33, RSN 923 = 2.87, RSN 1474 = 1.51, RSN 3471 = 1.71, RSN 6060 = 0.77 (lines 710-717), confirming minimum 0.64 and maximum 2.87. The period ranges are stated in KB Section 8.1: short period "0.062 s to 0.62 s (i.e., 0.2TS* to 2.0TS*)" and long period "0.23 s to 2.3 s (i.e., 0.2TL* to 2.0TL*)" (lines 644-647). The characterization of departing from typical limits is supported by KB Section 8.2 statement about "scale factors applied to prospective ground motions were generally kept within the range 0.5 to 4.0" (line 677), with the actual maximum 8.28 clearly exceeding this. The rationale about high-frequency spectral matching is stated in KB Section 8.3 (lines 689-690): "To capture the high-frequency (short-period) ground motions indicated by the 1/10,000 AEP UHS at the Louvicourt TSF site, records with shorter source-to-site distances were required."]

## SLOT 13: State-of-the-art guidance on amplitude scaling

The modern literature and state of the art regarding acceptable amplitude scaling factors for real ground-motion records reflects ongoing debate within the earthquake engineering community, with perspectives ranging from restrictive limits to more permissive approaches depending on application context and spectral compatibility. Research over the past two decades has investigated potential biases introduced by amplitude scaling, with some studies suggesting that large scaling factors may distort the frequency content and duration characteristics of ground motions in ways that affect nonlinear structural response. Early concerns about amplitude scaling led to proposals for relatively conservative limits, with some researchers advocating that scaling factors should remain close to unity or at most within a range of 0.5 to 2.0 to preserve the inherent characteristics of recorded ground motions. However, more recent large-scale investigations have produced encouraging results indicating that scaled records can be safely used in nonlinear response history analysis to assess seismic structural behavior if spectral compatibility and scenario compatibility are ensured. Studies examining scaling factor effects on structural demands have found that when proper selection procedures are followed, including matching to conditional spectra and verifying that sustained amplitude characteristics are consistent with the target hazard, the bias introduced by scaling is generally acceptable even for factors outside the most restrictive ranges. The research literature indicates that acceptable ranges for scaling factors vary depending on the target hazard level, with some sources suggesting that for target spectra with small probabilities of exceedance such as 2 percent in 50 years, scaling factors between 0.2 and 5.0 can be considered acceptable and should not automatically cause rejection of selected records. Professional practice standards including those reflected in ASCE 7 series of standards do not impose explicit hard limits on scaling factors but rather emphasize the importance of spectral matching requirements, where the average response spectrum of scaled ground motions must meet or exceed the target spectrum over specified period ranges. Recent research has demonstrated that the distribution of mean structural responses and intensity measures are generally free from scaling approaches and scaling levels when spectral compatibility is maintained, and that differences between demands obtained for different scaling levels are statistically insignificant at high confidence levels. The consensus emerging from state-of-the-art research is that spectral compatibility is more important than strict adherence to scaling factor limits, though practical considerations regarding record selection efficiency and confidence in scaled motion representativeness lead many practitioners to prefer factors roughly in the range 0.25 to 4.0 when sufficient candidate records are available. Some modern approaches advocate for use of conditional mean spectra rather than uniform hazard spectra as targets for ground motion selection, which can reduce the required scaling factors by better representing the spectral shape expected for the controlling scenarios.

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: The paragraph synthesizes information from external web search results on amplitude scaling factors. The range of 0.5 to 2.0 for conservative limits is mentioned in the search results as a restrictive approach. The range of 0.2 to 5.0 for 2% in 50-year hazard is directly quoted from the NIST/PEER search result which stated "For target spectra with small probability of exceedance (2% in 50 years), scaling factors between 0.2 and 5.0 can be considered as acceptable." The statement about recent large-scale investigations finding encouraging results is from the search results which stated "Recent large-scale investigations have found more encouraging results. The results indicate that scaled records can be safely used in NLRHA to assess the seismic structural behaviour if spectral and scenario compatibility are ensured." The characterization of debate in the community is supported by search results noting "the extent of amplitude scaling and its process has become a matter of debate, and various constraints on the scaling factors have been proposed." The statement about no explicit ASCE 7 hard limits is from search results indicating "although there is no limitation for scale factors in the codes themselves, customary values vary from 0.25 to 4." The range 0.25 to 4.0 as practical guidance is mentioned in the search results. The characterization of conditional mean spectra is consistent with modern PSHA practice though not extensively detailed in the search results. Confidence is MEDIUM because the synthesis combines multiple sources and interpretations, though all individual claims are traceable to the search results.]

## SLOT 14: Reasonableness of large/small amplification factors

Based on the modern literature and the specific context of the Louvicourt site assessment, the acceptance of amplification factors much greater than 2 or much smaller than 0.5 requires careful evaluation considering both general guidance and site-specific circumstances. Recent research examining amplitude scaling effects on structural response has found that scaling factors from 2 to 10 can introduce computational bias ranging from 15 to 60 percent for single-degree-of-freedom systems and 25 to 80 percent for multi-degree-of-freedom systems, suggesting that very large factors warrant scrutiny regarding potential distortion of ground motion characteristics. However, the same body of research also demonstrates that when spectral compatibility is rigorously maintained and scenario characteristics are properly matched, the statistical significance of bias diminishes, particularly when comparing results at high confidence levels. For the Louvicourt assessment, the use of scale factors as large as 8.28 and 6.85 in the short period suite represents a significant departure from commonly cited practical limits of 0.25 to 4.0, and these large factors merit specific justification. The primary justification provided in the assessment relates to the fundamental challenge of selecting ground motion records for a stable continental region site with very stiff bedrock conditions and high-frequency spectral demands from a database of recordings made in active tectonic regions with generally softer site conditions. The target uniform hazard spectrum for the Louvicourt site at the 1/10,000 annual exceedance probability exhibits relatively high spectral accelerations at short periods, reflecting the characteristics of stable continental region ground motions which can have rich high-frequency content due to low anelastic attenuation in crystalline rock. The NGA-West2 database records were predominantly recorded at sites with lower shear wave velocities than the Louvicourt bedrock condition of 1,853 meters per second, and achieving spectral match at high frequencies required substantial upward scaling for some records. The literature suggests that for rare target spectra with very low annual exceedance probabilities, somewhat larger scaling factors can be acceptable, with some sources indicating factors up to 5.0 or even higher may be reasonable when the physical basis for the high target ground motions is sound and alternative approaches such as spectral matching or synthetic ground motion generation are not employed. From a practical standpoint, the use of large scale factors in this context reflects the limited global inventory of strong motion recordings from large magnitude stable continental region earthquakes at distances of 100 to 200 km recorded on very stiff rock sites, which necessitates either accepting larger scale factors or resorting to alternative approaches such as synthetic ground motion simulation. Modern ground motion selection guidance emphasizes that the suitability of scaled records should be evaluated based on whether the scaled motions produce secondary intensity measures consistent with the target scenario, and the Louvicourt assessment did verify that cumulative absolute velocity, Arias intensity, and significant durations of the scaled records compare reasonably with conditional target values, which provides some confidence that the scaled records retain appropriate duration and energy characteristics despite the large amplitude scaling. Nevertheless, factors exceeding 6.0 or 8.0 push the boundaries of typical practice and introduce uncertainty regarding whether the scaled records fully represent the expected ground motion characteristics for the site, particularly considering that amplitude scaling preserves the time domain shape and frequency content of the original recording which may not be fully representative of stable continental region source and path effects. [KB:output.md][WEB:https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eqe.3534][WEB:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11831-023-10025-y]

^[Verdict: UNCERTAIN, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: The paragraph makes several verifiable claims but also includes interpretive engineering judgments about "reasonableness" that go beyond pure factual verification. The scale factors 8.28 and 6.85 are verified from KB Table 10 (lines 699-700). The bias ranges "15 to 60 percent for SDOF systems... 25 to 80 percent for MDOF systems... for scaling factors from 2 to 10" are directly quoted from the web search results. The site VS30 of 1,853 m/s is verified in KB Section 2.1 (line 306). The target of 1/10,000 AEP is confirmed throughout KB Section 8.0. The statement about NGA-West2 sites having lower VS30 than Louvicourt is a reasonable inference given the database composition, though not explicitly verified. The comparison with conditional IMs is stated in KB Section 8.3 (lines 685-686): "Figure 20 and Figure 21 show that the IMs of the selected motions are generally well matched to their theoretical values." The characterization of typical practice limits (0.25-4.0, up to 5.0 for rare events) is from web search results. The statement about limited SCR recordings is reasonable but not directly verified by a citation. The concern about factors "exceeding 6.0 or 8.0" pushing boundaries is an engineering judgment rather than a cited fact. The paragraph appropriately identifies the tension between practical constraints (limited database) and theoretical concerns (large scaling), but the ultimate judgment of "reasonableness" is interpretive. Verdict is UNCERTAIN because while factual claims are supported, the normative assessment of what is "reasonable" involves professional judgment that cannot be definitively verified as TRUE or FALSE from available evidence. Confidence is MEDIUM because the analysis is technically sound and grounded in KB data and literature, but the core question asks for a judgment rather than a factual determination.]

## SLOT 15: Selection criteria for the final suite (Tables 10 and 11)

The selection criteria for the final suites of seismic records presented in Tables 10 and 11 focused primarily on achieving spectral compatibility with the target uniform hazard spectrum within specified period ranges while maintaining consistency with secondary intensity measure targets. The fundamental selection requirement was that the geometric mean of the horizontal components of the suite of eight two-component records must fall between 90 percent and 130 percent of the target mean uniform hazard spectrum for the 1/10,000 annual exceedance probability across the period range of interest, which was 0.062 to 0.62 seconds for the short period suite and 0.23 to 2.3 seconds for the long period suite. Candidate records were evaluated for their ability to match the target spectrum through amplitude scaling, with the scaling factors adjusted to optimize the spectral fit within each period range. Beyond spectral matching, the secondary intensity measures of the scaled candidate records were compared against conditional target values for Arias intensity, cumulative absolute velocity, and significant durations calculated for the representative magnitude 7.3 and distance 170 km scenario. Records whose scaled secondary intensity measures compared reasonably well with the conditional intensity measure distributions were preferred, though strict matching of all secondary measures was not enforced as an absolute requirement. The selection process accepted records once the combined criteria of geometric mean spectral agreement within the 90 to 130 percent band and general consistency with secondary intensity measure targets were satisfied. The final suites presented in Tables 10 and 11 include records from various earthquakes worldwide drawn from the NGA-West2 database, encompassing different tectonic settings, source mechanisms including reverse, reverse oblique, strike-slip, and normal faulting, and a range of source-to-site distances predominantly shorter than the 170 km target distance. The evaluation of whether the final suites satisfy the selection criteria stated at the beginning of chapter 8.0 indicates general compliance with the spectral matching requirements, as the figures showing response spectra demonstrate good agreement between the geometric mean of the selected suites and the target spectrum within the period ranges of interest. The secondary intensity measures of the selected scaled records show distributions that generally encompass or slightly exceed the conditional target values, with the cumulative probability plots indicating reasonable though not perfect agreement. The selection process achieved the primary objective of providing suites of time histories that represent the 1/10,000 annual exceedance probability target hazard spectrum with appropriate consideration of ground motion duration characteristics, though the use of large scale factors for some records and shorter source-to-site distances than indicated by disaggregation represents practical accommodation to the limited availability of suitable recordings from stable continental region earthquakes. [KB:output.md]

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph accurately describes the selection criteria from KB Section 8.0. The 90-130% spectral matching criterion is stated in KB line 683: "the geometric mean of each suite of ground motions agrees well with the target spectra because it falls between 90% and 130% of the target spectra within the period range of interest." The period ranges are confirmed in KB Section 8.1: "0.062 s to 0.62 s" for short period and "0.23 s to 2.3 s" for long period (lines 644-647). The secondary IMs (AI, CAV, D5-75, D5-95) are listed in KB lines 629-630, 650-657. The scenario parameters Mw 7.3 at 170 km are in KB Section 8.1 (lines 622-624, 648). The number of records (eight two-component) is confirmed in KB line 615. The characterization of records from various sources and mechanisms is verified from Tables 10-11 which list earthquakes from USA, Taiwan, Italy, Japan with mechanisms "Reverse Oblique, Strike Slip, Reverse, Normal" (lines 697-717). The statement about shorter distances than target is confirmed in KB Section 8.3 (lines 687-689): "the selected suites of ground motions... include records with shorter source-to-site distances than suggested by the magnitude-distance-epsilon disaggregation results." The assessment of spectral agreement is supported by KB statement in line 683 and reference to Figures 18-19. The characterization of IM agreement as "generally" consistent is supported by KB Section 8.3 (line 685): "The IMs of the selected motions are generally well matched to their theoretical values. However, the IMs of the scaled motions appear higher relative to the target IMs." All factual claims are traceable to specific KB sections.]

## SLOT 16: Identification of SCR records in the final suite

Identification of which records in the final suites presented in Tables 10 and 11 originate from Stable Continental Regions versus active tectonic regions reveals that none of the selected earthquake acceleration time histories come from stable continental crust environments. All eight records in the short period suite listed in Table 10 are from earthquakes in active tectonic settings, including the North Palm Springs earthquakes in southern California, Hector Mine earthquake in California, Chi-Chi earthquake sequence in Taiwan, Umbria Marche earthquake in Italy, and Iwate earthquake in Japan, all of which occurred in regions characterized by active crustal deformation associated with plate boundaries or active intraplate tectonic processes. Similarly, all eight records in the long period suite listed in Table 11 are from active tectonic region earthquakes, including San Fernando earthquake in California, Loma Prieta earthquake in California, Landers earthquake in California, Big Bear earthquakes in California, and Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan. The classification of these source regions is determined by their tectonic setting, with California earthquakes associated with the San Andreas fault system and related structures along the Pacific-North American plate boundary, Taiwan earthquakes related to the collision between the Philippine Sea Plate and the Eurasian Plate, Japanese earthquakes associated with subduction zone tectonics and volcanic arcs, and Italian earthquakes related to the complex convergent boundary between the African and Eurasian plates. The absence of any Stable Continental Region records in the final suites reflects the practical limitation that the NGA-East database, which contains recordings from stable continental regions in central and eastern North America, lacks ground motion records from earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 5.85, making it unsuitable as a source for records to represent the magnitude 7.3 controlling scenario identified from the hazard disaggregation. This limitation necessitated the use of the NGA-West2 database, which predominantly contains recordings from active tectonic regions, combined with amplitude scaling to achieve compatibility with the stable continental region target spectrum derived from the NGA-East ground motion models and site-specific hazard analysis. The selected records therefore represent active tectonic region earthquakes that have been scaled to match the spectral characteristics and secondary intensity measures expected for stable continental region ground motions at the Louvicourt site, an approach that is commonly employed in engineering practice for stable continental region sites where the inventory of suitable recorded strong motions from appropriate tectonic settings is limited. [KB:output.md]

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph accurately identifies the tectonic setting of all records based on KB Tables 10 and 11 (lines 693-718). Table 10 lists: North Palm Springs USA (lines 697-698), Hector Mine USA (line 699), Chi-Chi Taiwan (lines 700-701), Umbria Marche Italy (line 702), Iwate Japan (lines 703-704) - all from active tectonic regions. Table 11 lists: San Fernando USA (line 710), Loma Prieta USA (lines 711-712), Landers USA (line 713), Big Bear USA (lines 714, 717), Chi-Chi Taiwan (lines 715-716) - all from active tectonic regions. The tectonic characterization of these regions (California = plate boundary, Taiwan = plate collision, Japan = subduction, Italy = convergent boundary) represents standard geologic knowledge consistent with the active tectonic classification. The explanation for lack of SCR records is directly stated in KB Section 8.2 (line 632): "The PEER NGA-East database was also consulted but lacked ground motions records with magnitudes greater than Mw 5.85" and Section 8.3 (line 631-632): "The PEER NGA-West2 database was used to create a catalogue of prospective ground motion records." The target scenario of Mw 7.3 is confirmed in KB Section 8.1 (lines 622-624). The characterization of this as "common practice" is supported by KB Section 8.3 which states this approach of using active region records scaled to SCR spectra is "commonly used when applying earthquake ground motions from plate boundary areas to intraplate stable continental regions" (lines 687-688). The assessment that NONE of the records are from SCR is definitively TRUE based on the earthquake locations and names listed in the KB tables.]
