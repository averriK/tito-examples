## SLOTS

### SLOT 1: Tectonic regimes within 1000 km
Using chapters 3.0 (Seismotectonic Setting) and 4.0 (Site-Specific Seismic Source Model) of the WSP PSHA report in the KB, identify and describe the tectonic regimes that control seismicity within a 1000 km radius around the project site. Explain briefly how each regime influences the seismicity relevant to the PSHA.

### SLOT 2: Source type classification (SCC)
Using the same chapters, determine whether all seismic sources included in the site-specific source model are of Stable Continental Crust (SCC) type (or the specific SCC definition used in the report). If not, clearly identify any non-SCC sources and their tectonic characterization.

### SLOT 3: Controlling events for frequent hazard levels
For the study region, identify the characteristic magnitudes and epicentral distances of the events that control the hazard at “frequent” annual exceedance probabilities (AEP) between 1/475 and 1/1000 years. Base the answer on the PSHA results (e.g., deaggregation or equivalent analyses) and summarize the key controlling scenarios.

### SLOT 4: Controlling events for rare hazard levels
For the same region, identify the characteristic magnitudes and epicentral distances of the events that control the hazard at “rare” AEPs between 1/5000 and 1/10,000 years. Again, rely on the PSHA results and clearly describe the dominant scenarios for these return periods.

### SLOT 5: Active neotectonic faults within 100 km
Determine whether there are identified active neotectonic faults within 100 km of the site. Summarize their location, style of faulting, and any parameters reported in the PSHA report that are relevant for the seismic source model.

### SLOT 6: Consideration of Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE)
Clarify whether a Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE) has been explicitly defined and calculated for any specific source in the PSHA. If so, specify for which sources, how the MCE was determined, and how (if at all) it is used in the hazard analysis.

### SLOT 7: Executive summary of ground-motion record selection
Provide an executive summary, in English, of how real ground-motion records (accelerograms) were selected in chapter 8.0 “EARTHQUAKE ACCELERATION TIME HISTORY DEVELOPMENT” to be compatible with the site and the PSHA results. Emphasize the main selection steps and criteria.

### SLOT 8: Adequacy of basic selection criteria (M 7.3, Rrup 170 km, etc.)
Analyze the selection criteria in chapter 8.0 (e.g., magnitude 7.3, rupture distance ≈170 km, and other parameters) and assess whether they are appropriate for the tectonic setting of the region, which is described as a Stable Continental Region (SCR). Justify your assessment using both the PSHA report and relevant external literature on SCR ground motions.

### SLOT 9: Origin and validity of the 170 km rupture distance
Explain the origin of the 170 km rupture distance used as a selection criterion (for example, whether it comes from hazard deaggregation or another analysis). Clarify for which return periods or hazard levels this distance is valid and how it relates to the controlling scenarios identified in the PSHA.

### SLOT 10: Application of "depth-to-top rupture" and "rupture plane dip 90" criteria
Investigate whether the criteria such as “depth-to-top rupture” and “rupture plane dip = 90°” were actually applied when constructing Tables 10 and 11 in the PSHA report. Verify, as far as possible, from public ground-motion catalogs and the report itself whether these parameters were available and used for the selected records.

### SLOT 11: Selection of candidate ground-motion records
For point 3 of chapter 8.0 (“A catalogue of candidate ground motion records”), identify who (or what process) selected the candidate records and which explicit criteria were used to build this catalogue. Summarize those criteria and relate them to the earlier stated selection requirements.

### SLOT 12: Amplitude-scaling factors (min/max)
For point 4 in chapter 8.0, where candidate ground motions are amplitude-scaled to match the target spectrum, determine the minimum and maximum amplification (scaling) factors applied to the selected records. Report these factors and comment on their range.

### SLOT 13: State-of-the-art guidance on amplitude scaling
Summarize the modern literature and state of the art regarding acceptable amplitude-scaling factors for real ground-motion records. Discuss what ranges are generally considered reasonable, and under what conditions larger or smaller factors may be justified.

### SLOT 14: Reasonableness of large/small amplification factors
Based on the literature review and any available data from the PSHA, assess whether it is reasonable in this context to accept amplification factors much greater than 2 or much smaller than 0.5. Cite modern references that explicitly discuss limits or recommendations for amplitude scaling factors.

### SLOT 15: Selection criteria for the final suite (Tables 10 and 11)
For Tables 10 and 11 of the PSHA report, explain the criteria by which the final suite of seismic records was chosen from the broader candidate catalogue. Evaluate whether the final suite satisfies the selection criteria stated at the beginning of chapter 8.0.

### SLOT 16: Identification of SCR records in the final suite
From Tables 10 and 11, identify which records clearly come from Stable Continental Regions (SCR) and which do not. Provide a short justification (e.g., tectonic classification from the source database) for each record’s classification.

## CONSTRAINTS

- The original PSHA report in the KB (prepared by WSP) is the primary document; use chapters 3.0, 4.0, and 8.0 as indicated in the task.
- All content in this structured prompt must be written in English.
- All downstream research outputs answering these slots must also be written in English.
- In the final research report, create one top-level `##` section per slot/question so that each question is answered in its own section.
- Use clear, technical language appropriate for a PSHA and engineering-seismology audience.
- When external literature is needed (e.g., for amplitude scaling best practices), prefer modern, peer-reviewed sources and explicitly cite them.
