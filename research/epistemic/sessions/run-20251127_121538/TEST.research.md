# Epistemic Uncertainty Analysis: Reitfontein Fault Parameters for PSHA at South Deep Mine

## Fault activity classification

The Reitfontein Fault does not meet the conventional criteria for neotectonic classification but instead appears to be a paleoseismic structure with minor present-day activity [KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. A neotectonic fault is defined as one that has hosted displacement under conditions imposed by the current crustal stress regime and therefore may move again in the future [WEB:https://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/1997/c1112/crone.html]. The current crustal stress regime in South Africa was established sometime in the last 40 to 11 million years [KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. Active faults are conventionally defined as structures known to have produced historical earthquakes or shown evidence of movement in the last 35,000 years [KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The Reitfontein Fault is at least 2.0 Ga old and has accommodated both normal and oblique reverse movement in the geological past [KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. There is no known geological or geomorphological evidence to suggest neotectonic activity on this structure [KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The fault has only been associated with minor present-day seismic activity according to Singh et al. (2009) and references therein [KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The characterization as a reportedly active fault with an assigned slip rate of 1 m/Myr represents a conservative engineering assumption rather than empirical evidence of neotectonic displacement [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. In stable continental regions like South Africa, faults may exhibit episodic behavior with recurrence intervals of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years between ground-rupturing events [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. The Singh et al. (2009) reference cited in the South Deep report is a synthesis paper titled "Seismotectonic models for South Africa: Synthesis of geoscientific information, problems, and the way forward" published in Seismological Research Letters [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. External validation confirms that Singh et al. (2009) specifically identified the Reitfontein Fault as one of several faults requiring reassessment to determine if still active, alongside the Thabazimbi, Zebediela, Zoetfontein, Dreyling, Hebron, and Cedarville faults [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. The South Deep report's use of the phrase "and references therein" when citing Singh et al. (2009) suggests this is a secondary citation rather than primary observational data [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. Singh's paper represents a comprehensive review synthesizing geoscientific information to explain earthquake clusters across South Africa [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. The paper's identification of Reitfontein as requiring reassessment does not constitute evidence that Singh et al. classified the fault as active neotectonic; rather, it indicates the fault's activity status was uncertain and merited further investigation [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph synthesizes multiple lines of evidence from KB documents regarding the Reitfontein Fault's classification status. The KB sources consistently state that the fault is at least 2.0 Ga old with no known geological or geomorphological evidence of neotectonic activity [KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md], and that the 1 m/Myr slip rate is "a conservative engineering assumption rather than empirical evidence" [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The definition of neotectonic faults (movement in last 35,000 years under current stress regime) and the characterization of the Reitfontein Fault as not meeting these criteria are directly supported by cited KB sources. The discussion of Singh et al. (2009) as identifying the fault as requiring reassessment rather than confirming active status is explicitly stated in KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md. The statements about stable continental regions exhibiting episodic behavior with long recurrence intervals are directly cited to KB sources. All claims are well-supported by multiple consistent KB citations with no contradictions detected.]

## Recent activity evidence (35,000 years)

Based on the KB findings, there is no evidence to affirm that the Reitfontein Fault had activity in the last 35,000 years [KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The fault is documented as having only minor present-day seismic activity according to Singh et al. (2009) [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. However, this minor seismic activity likely represents stress perturbations related to mining operations rather than evidence of capability for large-magnitude rupture [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. Mining-induced seismicity in the Witwatersrand Basin, where South Deep Mine is located, falls into two main categories: collapsing of highly stressed rock masses and shear or rupture along geological planes of weakness such as faults, joints, and dykes [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The largest mining-related seismic event ever to occur in South Africa registered magnitude 5.3 on March 9, 2005 [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The mechanism by which mining influences seismicity involves stress redistribution due to excavation at deep levels, which may result in fracture initiation and movement along pre-existing fracture planes [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. Most seismic events associated with mining are localized to the mining area and adjacent structures [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The PSHA study methodology acknowledges the complexity of mining-induced seismicity by excluding events suspected of being mining-related with magnitudes less than M4.0 in order to minimize the influence of induced seismicity in hazard estimates [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The Pretorius Fault provides an instructive comparison: this structure ruptured during the 2004 M2.2 TauTona Mine earthquake, with exposures within mine tunnels showing that segments of the fault were reactivated, but the rupture was limited to local segments rather than the entire mapped fault length of 10 km [KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The Reitfontein Fault, spanning 64 km at a distance of 43 km from the South Deep Mine site, is substantially farther from mining operations than the Pretorius Fault at 18 km [KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. A comprehensive assessment would require attempting to separate local forced and triggered induced seismicity from naturally occurring tectonic seismicity and treating these as separate logic branches [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The absence of quantified slip-rate data for the Reitfontein Fault reflects the general paucity of paleoseismic studies on South African faults [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. A field investigation would be required to improve understanding of faults near the South Deep Mine site and to reduce uncertainties associated with the activity rates of the active structures included in the study [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: This paragraph accurately addresses whether the Reitfontein Fault shows evidence of activity in the last 35,000 years based on KB sources. The core claim that there is no evidence to affirm activity in the last 35,000 years is directly supported by KB statements that there is "no known geological or geomorphological evidence to suggest neotectonic activity on this structure" [KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The discussion of mining-induced seismicity is comprehensively supported by KB citations including specific details about the March 9, 2005 magnitude 5.3 event [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md], the mechanisms of mining-induced seismicity [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md], and the PSHA study's methodology of excluding mining-related events below M4.0 [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The comparison with the Pretorius Fault and the specific distances (43 km for Reitfontein, 18 km for Pretorius) are directly cited to KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md. The statements about the need for field investigations and the paucity of paleoseismic studies are explicitly stated in both KB documents. All quantitative claims (magnitudes, distances, dates) are directly supported by KB citations.]

## Logic tree weight for Mmax=7.2

In a logic tree for $M_{max}$, assigning weight to $M_{max}=7.2$ for the Reitfontein Fault requires careful consideration of multiple lines of evidence and significant epistemic uncertainty [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The $M_{max}$ of 7.2 assigned to the Reitfontein Fault has been determined using the relationship published in Wells and Coppersmith (1994) based on the 64 km surface expression of the structure [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md][WEB:https://www.resolutionmineeis.us/sites/default/files/references/wells-coppersmith-1994.pdf]. Wells and Coppersmith (1994) developed empirical relationships among moment magnitude, surface rupture length, subsurface rupture length, and rupture area based on a global compilation of historical earthquakes, with log-linear regressions showing standard deviations of 0.25 to 0.35 magnitude units [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md][WEB:https://www.resolutionmineeis.us/sites/default/files/references/wells-coppersmith-1994.pdf]. However, several considerations affect the appropriateness of this estimate for the Reitfontein Fault: not all mapped fault length necessarily represents seismogenic length capable of rupturing in a single earthquake, stable continental region earthquakes may exhibit different scaling relationships than the predominantly active tectonic region earthquakes that dominate the Wells and Coppersmith dataset, and the 64 km length likely includes segments that are favorably oriented in the current stress regime as well as segments that may be less likely to rupture [KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The $M_{max} = 7.2$ assigned to the Reitfontein Fault represents an unusually high value for the South African stable continental region and exceeds most instrumentally observed cratonic seismicity [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. South Africa is located in a stable continental region (SCR) with the largest recorded earthquake being the Ceres event of September 29, 1969, with magnitude $M_w$ 6.2 [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. Research on stable continental regions has found that Archean and Early Proterozoic cratonic lithosphere with higher than average shear-wave velocity have fewer crustal earthquakes and a lower value of the maximum moment magnitude, with no earthquakes with $M_w > 6$ having occurred above mantle lithosphere with $\delta V_S > 3.5\%$, and for cratonic interiors with seismically determined thick lithosphere, the maximum moment magnitude found in the earthquake catalog is $M_{cmax} = 6.0$ [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The Kaapvaal Craton, where the Reitfontein Fault is located, is an Archean craton formed between 2.7 and 3.7 Ga, placing it squarely in this category of stable, thick lithosphere with potentially limited seismogenic capacity [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. However, paleoseismic evidence from stable continental regions globally indicates that prehistoric earthquakes may have greatly exceeded maximum observed instrumental magnitudes, with studies having identified normal fault scarps in SCRs interpreted as having failed in large ($M_w > 7$) earthquakes [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The regional $M_{max}$ context from seismicity models employed in the South Deep PSHA study reveals substantial variability: the EZ-FRISK Africa model assigns $M_{max}$ values of 7.23 to the Drakensberg zone and 7.0 to the Kaapvaal zone, while the GEM ZAF model employs more conservative $M_{max}$ estimates, with the ZEBED zone (which includes the study area) having $M_{max}$ values of 5.28 (weight 0.45), 5.53 (weight 0.35), and 5.93 (weight 0.20) [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. For the Reitfontein Fault, $M_{max} = 7.2$ falls within the range of regional area source values (particularly the EZ-FRISK Drakensberg $M_{max} = 7.23$) but exceeds the more conservative GEM ZAF ZEBED zone estimates [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The Kango Fault in the southern Cape Fold Belt represents the benchmark for active South African faults, with measured slip rates on the order of 200 m/Myr and paleoseismic investigations identifying an early Holocene earthquake with magnitude $M_w$ 6.97-7.18 based on a 2.0 plus or minus 0.06 m fault scarp, demonstrating that earthquakes exceeding $M_w$ 7.0 are possible in South Africa [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. Based on this evidence, a proposed logic tree for $M_{max}$ would include three branches: $M_{max} = 6.5$ with weight 0.40 (representing the conservative view based on instrumental seismicity and cratonic characteristics), $M_{max} = 7.2$ with weight 0.45 (representing the Wells-Coppersmith scaling for the full 64 km length), and $M_{max} = 7.5$ with weight 0.15 (representing the possibility of even larger events suggested by paleoseismic evidence from other SCRs and the Kango Fault precedent) [ARXIV:2209.10401][WEB:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00024-022-03143-4]. The dominant weight of 0.45 on $M_{max} = 7.2$ reflects that this value is derived from a widely accepted empirical relationship applied to a clearly mapped 64 km fault length, but the significant weight of 0.40 on the lower value acknowledges the cratonic setting constraints and absence of empirical activity evidence, while the 0.15 weight on the higher value recognizes that SCR paleoseismic evidence globally suggests prehistoric events can exceed instrumental records [WEB:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00024-022-03143-4].

^[Verdict: UNCERTAIN, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: This paragraph synthesizes evidence from KB sources and external research to propose a logic tree for $M_{max}$ values. The factual statements about the Wells-Coppersmith relationship, the 64 km fault length, the 1969 Ceres earthquake magnitude of 6.2, the Archean age of the Kaapvaal Craton (2.7-3.7 Ga), the regional $M_{max}$ values from EZ-FRISK and GEM ZAF models, and the Kango Fault paleoseismic evidence ($M_w$ 6.97-7.18) are all directly supported by KB citations [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The discussion of cratonic characteristics ($M_{cmax} = 6.0$ for thick lithosphere) and paleoseismic evidence for events exceeding $M_w$ 7 in SCRs is also directly cited to KB sources. However, the specific proposed logic tree (6.5 with 0.40 weight, 7.2 with 0.45 weight, 7.5 with 0.15 weight) represents expert judgment synthesis rather than values explicitly stated in the KB. The KB documents describe the existing PSHA methodology as using b-value logic trees with three branches (1.35 at 0.30, 1.10 at 0.60, 1.99 at 0.10) but do not provide a specific $M_{max}$ logic tree structure. The rationale for the proposed weights is logically derived from the evidence presented (cratonic constraints, Wells-Coppersmith scaling, paleoseismic precedents) and is consistent with epistemic uncertainty approaches referenced in external citations [WEB:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00024-022-03143-4], but the specific numerical weights represent interpretive synthesis rather than empirically established values. The uncertainty classification reflects that while the evidence base is strong, the specific logic tree proposal involves expert judgment that goes beyond what is explicitly stated in the source documents.]

## Compatible slip-rates and logic tree

Based on the KB findings and regional seismotectonic context for stable continental crust, the compatible range of slip-rates for the Reitfontein Fault is extremely low, likely between 0.001 and 1.0 m/Myr [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md][WEB:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97167-w]. No empirical slip-rate evidence exists for the Reitfontein Fault; the 1 m/Myr value is an engineering assumption assigned in the absence of published data [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The PSHA study explicitly states that no slip rate has been published for this reportedly active fault, and therefore a slip rate of 1 m/Myr is assigned, representing the minimum conservative value typically used for faults that show evidence of activity but lack quantified slip-rate measurements [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The assignment of 1 m/Myr places the Reitfontein Fault at the lower end of the slip-rate spectrum for active structures in South Africa: for comparison, some of the more active faults in South Africa have slip rates in the order of 200 m/Myr, such as the Kango Fault [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The Pretorius Fault, which is classified as active and has demonstrated recent reactivation during mine seismicity, is also assigned a slip rate of 1 m/Myr in the absence of published estimates [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The methodology for assigning slip rates in PSHA studies follows a hierarchical approach: when possible, slip rates are applied based on previously determined values from geological or geodetic studies; when slip rates are not quantified, they are estimated based on all other available data; for bedrock faults that do not show evidence of movement in the last 10 million years but are included due to favorable orientation in the current stress regime, a low uplift rate of 1 m/Myr is assigned [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. Research from stable continental regions globally indicates that long-term fault slip rates are quite slow (much less than 1 mm/year), with the result that recurrence intervals of continental intraplate earthquakes can be on the order of 10,000 to 100,000 years [WEB:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97167-w][WEB:https://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/eqproc/sliprates.php]. Studies from Mongolia document a 25,000-year-long seismic cycle in a slow deforming continental region [WEB:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97167-w]. The Kaapvaal Craton's seismogenic structure, with documented activity at 5-16 km depth, is consistent with cratonic constraints for stable continental regions [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][WEB:https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018JB015631]. The Kaapvaal Craton is located away from tectonic plate boundaries, has ancient rigid crust, lacks nearby subduction zones, and experiences predominantly lower magnitude intraplate earthquakes, all of which contribute to reduced seismic risk and extremely low slip rates [WEB:https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018JB015631]. The lithospheric strength of the craton shows a varied character and probably most of the intraplate seismicity originates from weak zones, with seismicity dominated by events in the gold and platinum mining regions [WEB:https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018JB015631]. A proposed logic tree for slip-rates would include three branches: 0.01 m/Myr with weight 0.25 (representing the most conservative view for a truly inactive paleoseismic structure with no evidence of Holocene movement), 0.1 m/Myr with weight 0.40 (representing an intermediate value consistent with very low activity stable continental interior faults with episodic behavior), and 1.0 m/Myr with weight 0.35 (representing the current PSHA assumption and the minimum value typically assigned to potentially active structures in engineering practice) [WEB:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00024-022-03143-4]. The dominant weight of 0.40 on the intermediate value reflects that the fault likely has some residual capability for reactivation given its favorable orientation in the current stress regime and documented minor seismicity, but at rates far below those of demonstrably active neotectonic faults like the Kango Fault [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The 0.25 weight on the lowest value acknowledges the complete absence of empirical evidence for recent activity, while the 0.35 weight on 1.0 m/Myr recognizes that this is the established engineering practice for the PSHA and represents a defensible conservative assumption for safety-critical infrastructure [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The Kango Fault's 200 m/Myr slip rate is 200 times higher than Reitfontein's assigned rate, yet produces similar maximum magnitudes, creating an apparent paradox that highlights the extreme epistemic uncertainty in assigning parameters to infrequently active cratonic structures [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md].

^[Verdict: UNCERTAIN, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: This paragraph integrates KB evidence with external research on stable continental region slip rates to address compatible slip-rate ranges and propose a logic tree. The factual statements about the absence of empirical slip-rate data for the Reitfontein Fault, the 1 m/Myr engineering assumption, the Kango Fault's 200 m/Myr slip rate, and the Pretorius Fault's 1 m/Myr assignment are all directly supported by KB citations [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The hierarchical methodology for assigning slip rates and the specific values for bedrock faults (1 m/Myr for faults without evidence of movement in the last 10 million years) are explicitly stated in KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md. The Kaapvaal Craton seismogenic depth range (5-16 km) is cited to KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md. External research citations provide general context about stable continental region characteristics: long-term fault slip rates much less than 1 mm/year [WEB:https://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/eqproc/sliprates.php], 25,000-year seismic cycles in Mongolia [WEB:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97167-w], and Kaapvaal Craton rheological properties [WEB:https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018JB015631]. However, the specific proposed logic tree (0.01 m/Myr at 0.25 weight, 0.1 m/Myr at 0.40 weight, 1.0 m/Myr at 0.35 weight) represents expert judgment synthesis rather than values explicitly recommended in the KB documents or external sources. The KB documents describe the existing slip rate assignment but do not provide a slip-rate logic tree structure. The rationale for the proposed weights is logically consistent with the evidence presented (absence of empirical data, cratonic constraints, engineering practice) but involves interpretive synthesis beyond what is explicitly stated. The uncertainty classification reflects that while the evidence base for slip-rate ranges in stable continental regions is reasonably well supported, the specific logic tree proposal represents expert judgment that extends beyond the direct evidence.]

## Seismic movement probability in return periods

The range of slip-rates suggested in the previous analysis (0.01 to 1.0 m/Myr) permits the possibility that this fault could have seismic movements in return periods shorter than 1/10,000 years, but the probability is highly uncertain and depends strongly on which slip-rate branch is assumed [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md][WEB:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97167-w]. The Gutenberg-Richter b-value fundamentally controls the relative probability of different magnitude earthquakes but does not directly determine $M_{max}$ itself [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The Gutenberg-Richter seismicity recurrence equation states that $\log_{10}(n) = a_0 - b \times M$, where $b$ is the Richter b-value representing the relative proportion of small to large events, $M$ is earthquake magnitude, and $n$ is the number of earthquakes in magnitude range $M \pm \Delta M$, and above a given maximum magnitude $M_{max}$, the rate is assumed to be zero [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. For the Reitfontein Fault, the PSHA study employs three different b-values: 1.35 (weighted 0.30), 1.10 (weighted 0.60), and 1.99 (weighted 0.10) [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The b-value affects the slope of the magnitude-frequency distribution, with higher b-values indicating a greater proportion of smaller earthquakes relative to larger ones, and a lower b-value means that the ratio of large to small earthquakes is higher, which increases the probability of larger magnitude events approaching $M_{max}$ occurring within a given time period [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The parameter $a_0$ represents the number of earthquakes of magnitude zero or greater and defines the overall activity rate [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. Because of the low probability of very large earthquakes, $M_{max}$ does not critically affect ground motion recurrence estimates for return periods up to hundreds of years, especially when the b-value is high [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The weighted mean approach using multiple b-values captures epistemic uncertainty in the magnitude-frequency distribution, with the dominant weight of 0.60 on the intermediate b-value of 1.10 suggesting this is considered the most representative value for the Reitfontein Fault based on regional seismicity characteristics [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. The high b-value of 1.99 with low weight of 0.10 represents a scenario where earthquake activity is dominated by smaller events, making approach to $M_{max} = 7.2$ highly improbable, while conversely, the lower b-value of 1.35 with weight 0.30 increases the relative probability of larger magnitude events [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. The practical effect on hazard is that earthquakes approaching $M_{max}$ contribute minimally to short-return-period ground motions due to their extreme rarity, as evidenced by disaggregation analyses showing that the majority of hazard comes from lower magnitudes [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. The $M_{max}$ value primarily influences long-return-period hazard estimates (10,000 years and beyond) and deterministic scenario analyses [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. Research from stable continental regions indicates that long-term fault slip rates much less than 1 mm/year result in recurrence intervals of continental intraplate earthquakes on the order of 10,000 to 100,000 years [WEB:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97167-w][WEB:https://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/eqproc/sliprates.php]. Studies from Mongolia document a 25,000-year-long seismic cycle in a slow deforming continental region, with the excessive length of return time for large earthquakes making it more difficult to recognize earthquake series [WEB:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97167-w]. The Dead Sea Fault, characterized by slow slip rates, shows that large earthquakes (magnitude greater than or equal to 7.0) are rare, especially along slow-slipping plate boundaries, with recurrence times following a power-law distribution with a mean of 1400 plus or minus 160 years [WEB:https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/48/eaba4170.full]. For the Reitfontein Fault at the upper end of the proposed slip-rate range (1.0 m/Myr), large events ($M_w$ greater than 7) would be possible within 1/10,000 year return periods, but at the lower end (0.01 m/Myr), such events would likely have return periods exceeding 100,000 years, placing them well beyond the timeframe relevant for engineering design [WEB:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97167-w]. The maximum credible earthquake magnitude $M_{max}$ is not constrained by seismicity data but has been estimated from the tectonic setting by each earthquake recurrence model's authors, and disaggregation of the hazard generally shows that the majority of hazard, at least for moderate return periods, comes from lower magnitudes and is not unduly affected by the choice of $M_{max}$ [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: This paragraph addresses whether the suggested slip-rate range permits seismic movements in return periods less than 1/10,000 years by synthesizing Gutenberg-Richter parameters from KB sources with external research on stable continental region recurrence intervals. The detailed explanation of the Gutenberg-Richter relationship, including the equation $\log_{10}(n) = a_0 - b \times M$ and the definitions of parameters, is directly cited to KB sources [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The specific b-values for the Reitfontein Fault (1.35 at 0.30 weight, 1.10 at 0.60 weight, 1.99 at 0.10 weight) are explicitly stated in both KB documents. The discussion of how b-values affect magnitude-frequency distributions, the role of the $a_0$ parameter, and the statement that $M_{max}$ does not critically affect ground motion estimates for short return periods are all directly supported by KB citations. The external research citations provide complementary information about stable continental region recurrence intervals: 10,000 to 100,000 year intervals [WEB:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97167-w][WEB:https://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/eqproc/sliprates.php], the Mongolia 25,000-year cycle [WEB:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97167-w], and Dead Sea Fault recurrence of 1400±160 years [WEB:https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/48/eaba4170.full]. The synthesis statement that events at 1.0 m/Myr could occur within 1/10,000 years but at 0.01 m/Myr would exceed 100,000 years represents a logical extrapolation from the cited evidence rather than a direct citation, introducing some interpretive uncertainty. The confidence level is MEDIUM rather than HIGH because while the individual evidence components are well-supported, the specific application to the 1/10,000 year threshold involves combining multiple uncertain parameters (slip rate range, b-values, recurrence relationships) in a way that compounds uncertainty. The verdict is TRUE because the paragraph's core claim—that the slip-rate range permits the possibility of movements at less than 1/10,000 years but with high uncertainty—is reasonably supported by the combination of KB and external evidence.]

## Gutenberg-Richter parameters and b-value logic tree

The Gutenberg-Richter parameters for a fault of the Reitfontein type in a stable continental cratonic setting would fall within a specific range based on regional seismicity characteristics [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The b-value generally varies only slightly from region to region, being in the range 0.8 to 1.2, with the b-value usually found to be around unity (1.0) [WEB:https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8147673/][WEB:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutenberg-Richter_law]. For the Reitfontein Fault specifically, the PSHA study already employs three different b-values: 1.35 (weighted 0.30), 1.10 (weighted 0.60), and 1.99 (weighted 0.10) [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The regional context from seismicity models employed in the South Deep PSHA study provides additional constraints: the EZ-FRISK Africa model assigns b-values of 1.04 for the Drakensberg zone and 1.06 for the Kaapvaal zone [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. These regional values of approximately 1.0 to 1.1 are consistent with typical stable continental region b-values and suggest moderate ratios of small to large events [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md][WEB:https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8147673/]. The existing logic tree structure in the South Deep PSHA captures a wide range of epistemic uncertainty, with the b-value of 1.99 representing an unusually high value that would indicate extreme dominance of small events and make large magnitude events approaching $M_{max} = 7.2$ highly improbable [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. The dominant weight of 0.60 on b=1.10 appears well-justified given the regional seismicity models and the typical global range, as this value is close to unity and consistent with the Kaapvaal zone b-value of 1.06 [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md][WEB:https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8147673/]. The lower b-value of 1.35 with weight 0.30 provides reasonable representation of scenarios where larger magnitude events have somewhat higher relative probability, which is appropriate for capturing uncertainty about whether the fault could generate events approaching the Wells-Coppersmith predicted $M_{max}$ [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. A refined logic tree proposal for b-values would maintain a similar structure but with slightly adjusted weights: b=1.00 with weight 0.25 (representing the canonical Gutenberg-Richter value and consistency with regional area source models), b=1.10 with weight 0.50 (representing the most likely value based on regional Kaapvaal zone characteristics), and b=1.35 with weight 0.25 (representing the scenario where larger magnitude events have elevated probability relative to the typical distribution) [WEB:https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8147673/][WEB:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00024-022-03143-4]. This refined structure removes the b=1.99 branch as it appears to be an extreme outlier inconsistent with typical stable continental region seismicity characteristics and regional seismicity models, and instead anchors the lowest branch at the canonical b=1.0 value observed globally [WEB:https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8147673/][WEB:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutenberg-Richter_law]. The increased weight on the middle branch (from 0.60 to 0.50) and the addition of a b=1.0 branch with 0.25 weight better reflects the epistemic uncertainty while maintaining consistency with both the Kaapvaal zone regional model (b=1.06) and the global typical range [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md][WEB:https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8147673/]. The parameter $a_0$ would need to be determined using available earthquake data for the specific fault or region, with the seismicity parameters derived from the regional catalog after excluding mining-induced events below M4.0 as specified in the PSHA methodology [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. Logic trees are widely used to represent epistemic uncertainty in PSHA, involving populating branches with alternative models or parameter values and assigning weights that must represent the underlying continuous distribution and capture both best estimates and potential range of alternatives [WEB:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00024-022-03143-4]. Epistemic uncertainties are particularly critical in stable continental regions where the paradigms underlying seismicity models are still under discussion and few strong ground motion recordings are available [WEB:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00024-022-03143-4].

^[Verdict: UNCERTAIN, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: This paragraph addresses Gutenberg-Richter parameters and proposes a refined b-value logic tree by integrating KB evidence with external research on b-value ranges. The existing b-values for the Reitfontein Fault (1.35 at 0.30, 1.10 at 0.60, 1.99 at 0.10) are directly and accurately cited to both KB documents [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The regional b-values from the EZ-FRISK Africa model (1.04 for Drakensberg, 1.06 for Kaapvaal) are also explicitly stated in the KB sources [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The statement that b-values generally range from 0.8 to 1.2 with typical values around 1.0 is supported by external citations [WEB:https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8147673/][WEB:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutenberg-Richter_law]. The discussion of how b-values affect magnitude distributions and the role of the $a_0$ parameter is accurately cited to KB sources. The methodology of excluding mining-induced events below M4.0 is explicitly stated in the KB documents. However, the proposed refined logic tree (b=1.00 at 0.25, b=1.10 at 0.50, b=1.35 at 0.25) represents expert judgment and interpretive synthesis rather than values explicitly recommended in the KB or external sources. The rationale for removing the b=1.99 branch as an "extreme outlier inconsistent with typical stable continental region characteristics" is logical and supported by the cited typical range of 0.8-1.2 [WEB:https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8147673/], but this represents interpretation rather than explicit recommendation. The proposal to anchor at b=1.0 is justified by citations showing this is the canonical value [WEB:https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8147673/][WEB:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutenberg-Richter_law], but the specific weight distribution is expert judgment. The general principles about logic trees and epistemic uncertainty in stable continental regions are well-supported by external citations [WEB:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00024-022-03143-4]. The verdict is UNCERTAIN rather than TRUE because while the evidence base for typical b-value ranges is strong, the specific proposed logic tree structure involves interpretive synthesis and expert judgment that extends beyond what is explicitly stated in the sources, even though this synthesis is logically consistent with the cited evidence.]
