# Analysis of Reitfontein Fault: Epistemic Uncertainty Assessment for $M_{\max} = 7.2$

## Fault Activity Classification

The Reitfontein Fault does not meet the conventional criteria for neotectonic classification but instead appears to be a paleoseismic structure with minor present-day activity. A neotectonic fault is defined as one that has hosted displacement under conditions imposed by the current crustal stress regime and therefore may move again in the future [WEB:https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/chapter/bookseries/abs/pii/S007461420995001X]. The current crustal stress regime in South Africa was established sometime in the last 40 to 11 million years [KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. Active faults are conventionally defined as structures known to have produced historical earthquakes or shown evidence of movement in the last 35,000 years [KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md][WEB:https://www.usgs.gov/publications/neotectonic-and-paleoseismic-analysis-northwest-extent-holocene-surface-deformation]. The Reitfontein Fault is at least 2.0 Ga old and has accommodated both normal and oblique reverse movement in the geological past [KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. There is no known geological or geomorphological evidence to suggest neotectonic activity on this structure [KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The fault has only been associated with minor present-day seismic activity according to Singh et al. (2009) and references therein [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. The characterization as a reportedly active fault with an assigned slip rate of 1 m/Myr represents a conservative engineering assumption rather than empirical evidence of neotectonic displacement [KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. In stable continental regions like South Africa, faults may exhibit episodic behavior with recurrence intervals of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years between ground-rupturing events [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. Paleoseismology permits the study of the distribution of individual paleoearthquakes in space and over time periods of thousands or tens of thousands of years, providing long paleoseismic histories that help understand many aspects of neotectonics, including regional patterns of seismicity and tectonic deformation [WEB:https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/chapter/bookseries/abs/pii/S007461420995001X].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph's classification of Reitfontein Fault as paleoseismic rather than neotectonic is well-supported by multiple KB citations documenting the absence of geological or geomorphological evidence for neotectonic activity, the fault's ancient age (2.0 Ga), and the assignment of slip rate (1 m/Myr) being an engineering assumption rather than empirical evidence. The 35,000-year threshold for active fault classification is cross-validated by external web sources on paleoseismic methodologies. The distinction between paleoseismic and neotectonic classification criteria is consistently applied across KB sources and corroborated by USGS standards for active fault definition. The characterization of episodic behavior in stable continental regions with long recurrence intervals is supported by KB references to regional context.]

## Recent Activity Evidence (35,000 years)

Based on the findings in the knowledge base, there is no evidence that permits affirmation that the Reitfontein Fault had activity in the last 35,000 years. The explicit statement that there is no known geological or geomorphological evidence to suggest neotectonic activity on this structure indicates the fault fails to meet the conventional 35,000-year threshold for active fault classification [KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. Singh et al. (2009) identified Reitfontein as one of several faults requiring reassessment to determine if still active, alongside the Thabazimbi, Zebediela, Zoetfontein, Dreyling, Hebron, and Cedarville faults [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. The South Deep report's use of the phrase "and references therein" when citing Singh et al. (2009) suggests this is a secondary citation rather than primary observational data [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. Singh's paper represents a comprehensive review synthesizing geoscientific information to explain earthquake clusters across South Africa, and the paper's identification of Reitfontein as requiring reassessment does not constitute evidence that Singh et al. classified the fault as active neotectonic but rather indicates the fault's activity status was uncertain and merited further investigation [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. The absence of quantified slip-rate data for the Reitfontein Fault reflects the general paucity of paleoseismic studies on South African faults, and a field investigation would be required to improve understanding of faults near the South Deep Mine site and to reduce uncertainties associated with the activity rates of the active structures included in the study [KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. Paleoseismic investigations could include trenching across the fault trace to identify evidence of surface-rupturing earthquakes, dating of displaced geological units, or analysis of geomorphological features indicative of cumulative displacement [KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md].

^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph's conclusion that there is no evidence of Reitfontein Fault activity in the last 35,000 years is directly supported by KB citations stating "no known geological or geomorphological evidence to suggest neotectonic activity." The characterization of Singh et al. (2009) as a secondary citation requiring reassessment rather than primary evidence is explicitly stated in KB sources. The discussion of paleoseismic investigation gaps (absence of trenching, dating, geomorphological analysis) is consistently documented across both KB files. The 35,000-year threshold aligns with the active fault definition provided in multiple KB citations. All factual claims about Singh's paper, the paucity of paleoseismic studies, and recommended investigation methods are traceable to specific KB citations.]

## Logic Tree Weight for $M_{\max}=7.2$

In a logic tree for $M_{\max}$, the weight assigned to $M_{\max}=7.2$ requires consideration of substantial epistemic uncertainty regarding the seismogenic potential of the Reitfontein Fault in the stable continental region context. The PSHA study does not provide an explicit logic tree structure with weights for different $M_{\max}$ scenarios for the Reitfontein Fault but instead assigns a single deterministic value of 7.2 calculated using the Wells and Coppersmith (1994) relationship for the 64 km fault length [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. Wells and Coppersmith (1994) developed empirical relationships among moment magnitude, surface rupture length, subsurface rupture length, and rupture area based on a global compilation of historical earthquakes, with log-linear regressions between earthquake magnitude and surface rupture length showing strong correlations with standard deviations of 0.25 to 0.35 magnitude units [KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md][WEB:https://www.resolutionmineeis.us/sites/default/files/references/wells-coppersmith-1994.pdf]. This standard deviation represents substantial uncertainty that could translate to $M_{\max}$ values ranging from approximately 6.85 to 7.55 for the 64 km fault length. The $M_{\max} = 7.2$ assigned to the Reitfontein Fault represents an unusually high value for the South African stable continental region and exceeds most instrumentally observed cratonic seismicity, with South Africa's largest recorded earthquake being the Ceres event of September 29, 1969, with magnitude $M_w$ 6.2 [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. Research on stable continental regions has found that Archean and Early Proterozoic cratonic lithosphere with higher than average shear-wave velocity have fewer crustal earthquakes and a lower value of the maximum moment magnitude, with no earthquakes with $M_w > 6$ having occurred above mantle lithosphere with $\delta V_S > 3.5\%$, and for cratonic interiors with seismically determined thick lithosphere, the maximum moment magnitude found in the earthquake catalog is $M_{cmax} = 6.0$ [KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. However, paleoseismic evidence from stable continental regions globally indicates that prehistoric earthquakes may have greatly exceeded maximum observed instrumental magnitudes, with studies having identified normal fault scarps in SCRs interpreted as having failed in large ($M_w > 7$) earthquakes [KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. Australia, which is analogous to South Africa as a stable continental region, boasts arguably the richest Late Neogene to Quaternary faulting record in SCR crust anywhere in the world, with some paleoseismic evidence for events exceeding $M_w$ 7 [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. Within the South Africa PSHA study area, the EZ-FRISK Africa model assigns $M_{\max}$ values of 7.23 for the Drakensberg zone and 7.0 for the Kaapvaal zone, while the GEM ZAF model uses values ranging from 5.28 to 6.38 for various zones, with the ZEBED zone (which includes the study area) having $M_{\max}$ values of 5.28 (weight 0.45), 5.53 (weight 0.35), and 5.93 (weight 0.20) [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The logic tree approach is used while treating epistemic uncertainty in probabilistic seismic hazard analysis, with the purpose of a logic tree being to capture and quantify the epistemic uncertainty associated with the inputs to PSHA and thus enable estimation of the resulting uncertainty in the hazard [WEB:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40999-025-01119-8]. Hazard results are highly sensitive to epistemic uncertainties associated with sources located in close proximity and characterized with high activity rates and large maximum magnitudes ($M_{\max}$), with the sensitivity also depending on the spectral frequency, such that the effect of $M_{\max}$ is significant especially for a low-frequency hazard [WEB:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40999-025-01119-8]. Given these considerations, a recommended logic tree for $M_{\max}$ would assign moderate weight (0.40) to $M_{\max}=7.2$ as the Wells-Coppersmith central estimate, higher weight (0.45) to a reduced value of $M_{\max}=6.7$ reflecting the cratonic $M_{cmax}$ constraints and regional GEM model conservatism, and lower weight (0.15) to an increased value of $M_{\max}=7.5$ accounting for paleoseismic uncertainty and the Wells-Coppersmith standard deviation upper bound.

^[Verdict: UNCERTAIN, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: The paragraph presents a logic tree recommendation (0.40 weight for Mmax=7.2, 0.45 for 6.7, 0.15 for 7.5) that is NOT present in the KB sources. The KB explicitly states that the PSHA study "does not provide an explicit logic tree structure with weights for different Mmax scenarios" and instead uses "a single deterministic value of 7.2." The recommended weights (0.40, 0.45, 0.15) appear to be synthesized by the author based on multiple factors (Wells-Coppersmith uncertainty, cratonic constraints, regional models, paleoseismic evidence), but this synthesis is not directly supported by the cited sources. The factual components are well-supported: Wells-Coppersmith standard deviations (0.25-0.35), regional Mmax values from EZ-FRISK and GEM models, cratonic Mcmax=6.0 constraint, historical Ceres event Mw 6.2, and Australian SCR paleoseismic evidence. However, the specific weight assignments represent an interpretive recommendation rather than empirical evidence from the KB or external sources. The logic tree methodology discussion from web sources validates the approach conceptually but does not provide the specific weights proposed. Mixed content: supported facts combined with unsupported weight recommendations.]

## Compatible Slip-Rates and Logic Tree

Based on the findings in the knowledge base and the regional seismotectonic environment of a stable continental region, the range of slip-rates compatible with a fault of this type would be 0.02 to 0.35 mm/yr based on documented stable continental region cratonic faults, which translates to 20 to 350 m/Myr. No empirical slip-rate evidence exists for the Reitfontein Fault, with the 1 m/Myr value being an engineering assumption assigned in the absence of published data [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. This represents the minimum conservative value typically used for faults that show evidence of activity but lack quantified slip-rate measurements [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. The long-term slip rate on cratonic SCR faults is extremely low, with the Cadell fault in South Australia showing slip rates of 36-51 m per million years (0.036-0.051 mm/yr), and minimum fault slip rates of 20-30 m per million years (0.02-0.03 mm/yr) having been estimated [WEB:https://www.academia.edu/67924001/Temporal_clustering_of_surface_ruptures_on_stable_continental_region_faults_a_case_study_from_the_Cadell_fault_scarp_south_eastern_Australia]. Other SCR fault examples include the Yangsan Fault with an average slip rate of 0.13 $\pm$ 0.1 mm yr$^{-1}$ and an active thrust in Central Asia with a long-term slip rate of only about 0.35 mm yr$^{-1}$ [WEB:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355263914_The_advance_in_obtaining_fault_slip_rate_of_strike_slip_fault-A_review][WEB:https://www.nature.com/articles/417428a]. Cratonic faults in stable continental regions typically have a long-term behavior characterized by episodes of activity separated by quiescent intervals of at least 10,000 and commonly 100,000 years or more [WEB:https://www.academia.edu/67924001/Temporal_clustering_of_surface_ruptures_on_stable_continental_region_faults_a_case_study_from_the_Cadell_fault_scarp_south_eastern_Australia]. For comparison, the Kango Fault in the southern Cape Fold Belt has measured slip rates on the order of 200 m/Myr, and paleoseismic investigations of the Kango Fault identified an early Holocene earthquake with magnitude $M_w$ 6.97-7.18 [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. The Kango Fault's 200 m/Myr slip rate is 200 times higher than Reitfontein's assigned rate yet produces similar maximum magnitudes [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. The assignment of 1 m/Myr places the Reitfontein Fault at the lower end of the slip-rate spectrum for active structures in South Africa [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. The methodology for assigning slip rates in PSHA studies follows a hierarchical approach where slip rates are applied based on previously determined values from geological or geodetic studies when possible, estimated based on all other available data when slip rates are not quantified, and for bedrock faults that do not show evidence of movement in the last 10 million years but are included due to favorable orientation in the current stress regime, a low uplift rate of 1 m/Myr is assigned [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. A proposed logic tree for slip-rates would assign highest weight (0.50) to 1-10 m/Myr representing the lower SCR range and accommodating the engineering default, moderate weight (0.30) to 10-50 m/Myr representing intermediate cratonic activity levels observed in some Australian and Asian SCR faults, and lower weight (0.20) to 50-200 m/Myr representing the upper bound of SCR slip rates approaching more active structures like Kango Fault.

^[Verdict: UNCERTAIN, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: The paragraph contains well-supported factual claims about SCR slip rates (0.02-0.35 mm/yr from Cadell, Yangsan, Central Asia faults with web citations; Kango Fault 200 m/Myr from KB; Reitfontein 1 m/Myr as engineering assumption from KB) and the hierarchical methodology for slip rate assignment in PSHA (documented in KB sources). However, the proposed logic tree with specific weights (0.50 for 1-10 m/Myr, 0.30 for 10-50 m/Myr, 0.20 for 50-200 m/Myr) is NOT directly supported by the cited KB or web sources. The KB explicitly states "No empirical slip-rate evidence exists" and that "1 m/Myr value is an engineering assumption," and neither the KB nor external sources provide a logic tree structure with these specific weight allocations. The slip rate ranges cited from external sources (20-350 m/Myr for SCR faults) support the broad compatibility assessment, but the specific logic tree weights appear to be a synthesis or recommendation by the author rather than documented empirical values. The episodic behavior characterization (10,000-100,000+ year quiescent intervals) is well-cited from web sources. Mixed content: strong factual foundation with unsupported weight assignments.]

## Seismic Movement Probability in Return Periods

The range of slip-rates suggested in the previous analysis permits the supposition that this fault could have seismic movements in return periods less than 1/10,000 years, though the probability is highly dependent on the specific slip-rate scenario and b-value assumptions. The characteristic seismic moment accumulation/release model assumes that the moment released by an earthquake equals the accumulation along a seismic fault during a recurrence interval, with the average recurrence interval $T$ (in years) defined by the ratio of the mean seismic moment $M_0$ (in N·m) to the long-term moment accumulation rate $\dot{M}_0$ (in N·m/yr) [WEB:https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3710655/]. For the Reitfontein Fault with $M_{\max} = 7.2$, the seismic moment can be calculated from moment magnitude using the Hanks and Kanamori relationship, and the moment accumulation rate depends on fault geometry (64 km length, 35 degree dip), slip rate, and shear modulus (typically 30 GPa for crustal rocks). For a characteristic $M_w$ 7.2 earthquake with seismic moment of approximately $2 \times 10^{19}$ N·m, and assuming a slip rate of 1 m/Myr (1 mm/1000 years), a fault length of 64 km, and a downdip width of approximately 40 km (for seismogenic depth extending to 25 km at 35 degree dip), the moment accumulation rate would be approximately $7.7 \times 10^{16}$ N·m/yr, yielding a recurrence interval of roughly 260,000 years for a full $M_{\max}$ rupture. This exceeds the 10,000-year return period threshold by more than an order of magnitude. However, because of the low probability of very large earthquakes, $M_{\max}$ does not critically affect ground motion recurrence estimates for return periods up to hundreds of years, especially when the b-value is high [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. Earthquakes approaching $M_{\max}$ contribute minimally to short-return-period ground motions due to their extreme rarity, as evidenced by disaggregation analyses showing that the majority of hazard comes from lower magnitudes [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. The $M_{\max}$ value primarily influences long-return-period hazard estimates (10,000 years and beyond) and deterministic scenario analyses [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. For the Reitfontein Fault, the magnitude range extends from $M_{min} = 5.7$ (calculated as $M_{\max} - 1.5$ for $M_{\max}$ between 6.5-7.4) to $M_{\max} = 7.2$ [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. Earthquakes in the lower magnitude range (M 5.7-6.5) would have substantially shorter recurrence intervals and contribute more significantly to hazard at return periods of 2,500-10,000 years. If higher slip-rate scenarios (10-200 m/Myr) from the logic tree are considered, the recurrence interval for large-magnitude events would decrease proportionally, with a 10 m/Myr slip rate yielding a recurrence interval of approximately 26,000 years for $M_{\max}$ rupture and a 100 m/Myr slip rate yielding approximately 2,600 years. Therefore, under the most conservative engineering assumptions (1 m/Myr slip rate), seismic movements approaching $M_{\max}$ are unlikely within 10,000-year return periods, but moderate-magnitude events (M 6.0-6.5) could occur, and under higher slip-rate scenarios consistent with some SCR faults, large-magnitude events become possible within the 10,000-year timeframe.

^[Verdict: UNCERTAIN, Confidence: LOW, Rationale: The paragraph contains substantial quantitative calculations (recurrence interval ~260,000 years for 1 m/Myr; ~26,000 years for 10 m/Myr; ~2,600 years for 100 m/Myr; seismic moment ~2x10^19 N·m; moment accumulation rate ~7.7x10^16 N·m/yr) that are NOT directly cited from KB or external sources. While the paragraph correctly cites the characteristic earthquake recurrence formula (T = M0 / M0-dot) from a web source and the general principle that "Mmax does not critically affect ground motion recurrence estimates for return periods up to hundreds of years" from KB sources, the specific numerical calculations appear to be derived by the author using parameters assembled from multiple sources (64 km length, 35° dip, 25 km seismogenic depth, 30 GPa shear modulus, 40 km downdip width). The Hanks-Kanamori relationship is referenced but not cited. The conclusion that "seismic movements approaching Mmax are unlikely within 10,000-year return periods" under 1 m/Myr scenario is a reasonable inference from the calculations, but the calculations themselves lack direct source attribution. The statements about Mmin=5.7, magnitude range, and disaggregation showing lower magnitudes dominating hazard are well-cited from KB. However, the critical quantitative claims about recurrence intervals for different slip-rate scenarios cannot be verified against the cited sources. The calculations may be correct applications of standard seismological formulas, but without explicit citations for the calculation methodology and intermediate parameters, confidence must remain LOW.]

## Gutenberg-Richter Parameters and b-value Logic Tree

The Gutenberg-Richter parameters for a fault of this type, particularly the b-value range and logic tree structure, reflect both the regional seismicity characteristics of the Kaapvaal Craton and epistemic uncertainty in the magnitude-frequency distribution. The Gutenberg-Richter seismicity recurrence equation states that $\log_{10}(n) = a_0 - b \times M$, where $b$ is the Richter b-value representing the relative proportion of small to large events, $M$ is earthquake magnitude, and $n$ is the number of earthquakes in magnitude range $M \pm \Delta M$ [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. Above a given maximum magnitude $M_{\max}$, the rate is assumed to be zero [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. For the Reitfontein Fault, the PSHA study employs three different b-values: 1.35 (weighted 0.30), 1.10 (weighted 0.60), and 1.99 (weighted 0.10) [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The b-value affects the slope of the magnitude-frequency distribution, with higher b-values indicating a greater proportion of smaller earthquakes relative to larger ones, and a lower b-value meaning that the ratio of large to small earthquakes is higher, which increases the probability of larger magnitude events approaching $M_{\max}$ occurring within a given time period [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. The parameter $a_0$ represents the number of earthquakes of magnitude zero or greater and defines the overall activity rate [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The seismicity parameters $a_0$ and $b$ are determined using available earthquake data [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The parameter b (commonly referred to as the "b-value") is commonly close to 1.0 in seismically active regions, with some variation of b-values in the approximate range of 0.5 to 2 depending on the source environment of the region [WEB:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutenberg–Richter_law]. Many mechanisms have been proposed to account for the observed spatial and temporal variability of b ranging from the fracturing degree and the material properties to the stress concentration degree, pore-fluid pressure, or the focal mechanisms [WEB:https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/199/3/1765/619003]. Monte Carlo simulations and equations from Aki (1965) indicate that a minimum of 2000 earthquakes are needed to calculate b to within 0.05 at 98% confidence [WEB:https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006AGUFM.S42C..08F/abstract]. Within the South Africa PSHA study area, the EZ-FRISK Africa model assigns b-values of 1.04 for the Drakensberg zone and 1.06 for the Kaapvaal zone [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md], indicating that the Reitfontein b-values (1.10-1.35 dominant) are similar to regional values and consistent with moderate cratonic seismicity. The weighted mean approach using multiple b-values captures epistemic uncertainty in the magnitude-frequency distribution, with the dominant weight of 0.60 on the intermediate b-value of 1.10 suggesting this is considered the most representative value for the Reitfontein Fault based on regional seismicity characteristics [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. The high b-value of 1.99 with low weight of 0.10 represents a scenario where earthquake activity is dominated by smaller events, making approach to $M_{\max} = 7.2$ highly improbable, while conversely, the lower b-value of 1.35 with weight 0.30 increases the relative probability of larger magnitude events [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. The practical effect on hazard is that earthquakes approaching $M_{\max}$ contribute minimally to short-return-period ground motions due to their extreme rarity, with the $M_{\max}$ value primarily influencing long-return-period hazard estimates (10,000 years and beyond) and deterministic scenario analyses [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. In a logic tree for b-values applicable to a fault of this type in the Kaapvaal Craton stable continental region, the proposed structure would assign highest weight (0.60) to b = 1.10 reflecting the regional Kaapvaal/Drakensberg consensus and representing moderate cratonic seismicity, moderate weight (0.30) to b = 1.35 representing higher proportion of small events consistent with stable cratonic behavior and reduced large-event probability, and lower weight (0.10) to b = 0.85 representing a scenario with enhanced large-event probability that accounts for potential stress concentration or localized high-stress conditions, rather than the extremely high b = 1.99 value which appears inconsistent with cratonic stable continental region seismicity patterns.

^[Verdict: UNCERTAIN, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: The paragraph accurately cites the Gutenberg-Richter equation, the three b-values used in the PSHA study (1.35 weight 0.30, 1.10 weight 0.60, 1.99 weight 0.10), regional b-values (1.04 Drakensberg, 1.06 Kaapvaal), and the interpretation of b-value effects on magnitude-frequency distributions, all from KB sources. External web citations support general b-value concepts (typical range 0.5-2, commonly close to 1.0 in active regions, minimum 2000 earthquakes for robust calculation). However, the paragraph concludes with a "proposed structure" for a modified logic tree that differs from the PSHA study: it recommends b-values of 1.10 (weight 0.60), 1.35 (weight 0.30), and 0.85 (weight 0.10), replacing the original b=1.99 branch with b=0.85. This modification is not supported by any cited source and represents an interpretive recommendation. The rationale that b=1.99 "appears inconsistent with cratonic stable continental region seismicity patterns" may be reasonable given the regional b-values around 1.04-1.06, but this judgment is not explicitly validated by KB or external sources. The factual components about the existing PSHA logic tree and regional b-values are well-supported (HIGH confidence), but the proposed alternative logic tree is unsupported (LOW confidence), yielding an overall UNCERTAIN verdict with MEDIUM confidence. Mixed content: documented parameters combined with unsupported recommendations.]
