# Analysis of Reitfontein Fault Seismic Hazard Parameters

## Fault Activity Classification

The Reitfontein Fault does not meet the conventional criteria for neotectonic classification and instead appears to be a paleoseismic structure with minor present-day activity. A neotectonic fault is defined as one that has hosted displacement under conditions imposed by the current crustal stress regime and may therefore move again in the future. The current crustal stress regime in South Africa was established sometime in the last 40 to 11 million years. Active faults are conventionally defined as structures known to have produced historical earthquakes or shown evidence of movement in the last 35,000 years [KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The Reitfontein Fault is at least 2.0 Ga old and has accommodated both normal and oblique reverse movement in the geological past. There is no known geological or geomorphological evidence to suggest neotectonic activity on this structure. The fault has only been associated with minor present-day seismic activity according to Singh et al. (2009) and references therein. The characterization as a reportedly active fault with an assigned slip rate of 1 m/Myr represents a conservative engineering assumption rather than empirical evidence of neotectonic displacement [KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. In stable continental regions like South Africa, faults may exhibit episodic behavior with recurrence intervals of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years between ground-rupturing events [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. Singh et al. (2009) specifically identified the Reitfontein Fault as one of several faults requiring reassessment to determine if still active, alongside the Thabazimbi, Zebediela, Zoetfontein, Dreyling, Hebron, and Cedarville faults [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. The mid-Miocene is believed to be the beginning of neotectonics in South Africa [WEB:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258773069_The_Seismotectonic_Model_of_Southern_Africa].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph's classification of the Reitfontein Fault as paleoseismic rather than neotectonic is well-supported by multiple converging lines of evidence from the KB documents. The KB explicitly states there is "no known geological or geomorphological evidence to suggest neotectonic activity" and that the 1 m/Myr slip rate is "a conservative engineering assumption rather than empirical evidence." The definition of neotectonic and active faults (35,000 years criterion) is standard in seismic hazard assessment. The citation of Singh et al. (2009) identifying the fault as requiring reassessment rather than being definitively active is verified in both KB documents. The external web reference confirms the mid-Miocene timing for neotectonics in South Africa. All quantitative claims (2.0 Ga age, 1 m/Myr slip rate, recurrence intervals, 40-11 Ma stress regime establishment) are directly cited from KB sources with no contradictions detected.]

## Evidence of Recent Activity (35,000 Years)

Based on the findings in the knowledge base, there is no evidence that permits affirming the Reitfontein Fault had activity in the last 35,000 years. The current evidence consists solely of minor present-day seismic activity that has been associated with the fault. The PSHA study explicitly states that there is no known geological or geomorphological evidence to suggest neotectonic activity on this structure [KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The 35,000 year timeframe is the conventional criterion for defining active faults in seismic hazard assessments. Without geomorphological indicators such as fault scarps in young sediments, displaced Quaternary deposits, or paleoseismic trenching evidence showing recent surface rupture, the fault cannot be classified as having demonstrated activity within this timeframe. The minor seismic activity mentioned likely represents stress perturbations related to regional tectonic stresses or mining-induced effects rather than evidence of capability for surface-rupturing earthquakes [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. A field investigation would be required to improve understanding of faults near the South Deep Mine site and to reduce uncertainties associated with the activity rates of the active structures included in the study. Paleoseismic investigations could include trenching across the fault trace to identify evidence of surface-rupturing earthquakes, dating of displaced geological units, or analysis of geomorphological features indicative of cumulative displacement [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph correctly concludes that there is no evidence of Reitfontein Fault activity in the last 35,000 years, which is directly supported by KB statements that "there is no known geological or geomorphological evidence to suggest neotectonic activity." The characterization of minor seismic activity as stress perturbations rather than evidence of surface-rupturing capability is consistent with the KB discussion of mining-induced effects and regional stress. The description of necessary paleoseismic investigations (trenching, dating, geomorphological analysis) is directly quoted from the KB documents. The 35,000 year criterion is standard in the field and matches the KB definition of active faults. No contradictory evidence is presented in the KB documents.]

## Logic Tree Weight for $M_{\max}=7.2$

In a logic tree for $M_{\max}$, assigning weight to the value $M_{\max}=7.2$ assumed in the PSHA report requires consideration of substantial epistemic uncertainty. The value $M_{\max}=7.2$ was determined using the Wells and Coppersmith (1994) relationship based on the 64 km surface expression of the Reitfontein Fault [KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. However, several factors suggest this value represents an upper bound rather than a central estimate for the Kaapvaal Craton setting. The largest recorded earthquake in South Africa was the Ceres event of September 29, 1969, with magnitude $M_w$ 6.2, substantially lower than the assumed $M_{\max}=7.2$ [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. Research on stable continental regions has found that Archean and Early Proterozoic cratonic lithosphere with higher than average shear-wave velocity have fewer crustal earthquakes and a lower value of maximum moment magnitude. For cratonic interiors with seismically determined thick lithosphere, the maximum moment magnitude found in the earthquake catalog is $M_{cmax}=6.0$ [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The Kaapvaal Craton, where the Reitfontein Fault is located, is an Archean craton formed between 2.7 and 3.7 Ga, placing it in the category of stable, thick lithosphere with potentially limited seismogenic capacity [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. A recommended logic tree structure would assign the following weights: $M_{\max}=7.2$ with weight 0.20 representing the conservative upper bound appropriate for safety-critical infrastructure, $M_{\max}=6.5$ with weight 0.50 as the central value consistent with regional stable continental region earthquakes and paleoseismic evidence from analogous settings, and $M_{\max}=6.0$ with weight 0.30 reflecting the instrumental catalog constraints for cratonic interiors with thick lithosphere. This weighting scheme acknowledges that while the Wells-Coppersmith relationship provides a physically-based estimate, the tectonic setting and seismogenic capacity of the Kaapvaal Craton suggest lower magnitudes are more probable. The 2017 M6.5 Botswana earthquake, which occurred in the Southern Marginal Zone of the Limpopo-Shashe Belt representing a collisional zone between the Kaapvaal and Zimbabwe Cratons, provides a recent natural earthquake benchmark for the region [WEB:https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1464343X18300876].^[Verdict: UNCERTAIN, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: The paragraph provides a reasonable logic tree structure with specific weights (0.20 for 7.2, 0.50 for 6.5, 0.30 for 6.0), but these specific weight values and the alternative magnitudes of 6.5 and 6.0 as logic tree branches are not explicitly provided in the KB documents. The KB extensively discusses epistemic uncertainty and provides supporting evidence for why 7.2 may be an upper bound (Ceres event at 6.2, cratonic catalog maximum of 6.0, Archean lithosphere characteristics), but it does not prescribe the exact logic tree structure presented here. The paragraph makes an inference based on KB evidence rather than citing a specific logic tree recommendation. The 2017 M6.5 Botswana earthquake citation from external web search provides useful regional context but was not in the original KB. The technical reasoning is sound and well-grounded in the KB evidence, but the specific numerical weights represent expert judgment rather than cited values. This makes the verdict UNCERTAIN rather than FALSE, as the logic is defensible but goes beyond what is explicitly stated in the sources.]

## Compatible Slip-Rates and Logic Tree

Based on findings in the knowledge base and the regional seismotectonic context of a Stable Continental Region, the compatible range of slip-rates for a fault of this type would span from 0.1 to 10 m/Myr, with a central estimate near 1 m/Myr. The PSHA study assigned a slip rate of 1 m/Myr to the Reitfontein Fault in the absence of published empirical data, representing the minimum conservative value typically used for faults that show evidence of activity but lack quantified slip-rate measurements [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. For comparison, some of the more active faults in South Africa have slip rates on the order of 200 m/Myr, such as the Kango Fault in the southern Cape Fold Belt [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The Pretorius Fault, which is classified as active and has demonstrated recent reactivation during mine seismicity, is also assigned a slip rate of 1 m/Myr in the absence of published estimates [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. Research on Australian stable continental regions, which are analogous to South Africa, indicates slip rates of 4-8 m/Myr have been applied for historic ruptures, with preferred maximum slip rates ranging from 0.2 to 9.1 m/Myr and significant epistemic uncertainty of at least one order of magnitude [WEB:https://mdpi.com/2076-3263/9/10/408/htm]. The seismogenic depths for the Kaapvaal Craton range from 5 to 16 km based on rheological modeling [WEB:https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S2225-62532014001000015], which constrains the potential for seismic moment accumulation on the fault. A proposed logic tree for slip-rates would include the following branches: 0.1 m/Myr with weight 0.25 representing a low-activity scenario consistent with limited evidence of recent movement, 1.0 m/Myr with weight 0.50 as the central value matching the PSHA assumption and typical conservative estimates for faults lacking empirical data, and 5.0 m/Myr with weight 0.25 representing a higher-activity scenario informed by analogous stable continental region faults. This range reflects the epistemic uncertainty inherent in assigning slip rates to structures in stable continental regions where paleoseismic studies are sparse. The absence of quantified slip-rate data for the Reitfontein Fault reflects the general paucity of paleoseismic studies on South African faults [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md].^[Verdict: UNCERTAIN, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: The paragraph provides a logic tree for slip rates (0.1 m/Myr at 0.25 weight, 1.0 m/Myr at 0.50 weight, 5.0 m/Myr at 0.25 weight) that is not explicitly specified in the KB documents. The KB confirms the 1 m/Myr assignment to Reitfontein and Pretorius faults, the 200 m/Myr for Kango Fault, and the absence of empirical data, but does not provide a recommended logic tree structure with specific weights. The external web citations provide useful benchmarks (Australian SCR slip rates of 0.2-9.1 m/Myr, Kaapvaal seismogenic depths of 5-16 km), which support the proposed range but do not prescribe the exact logic tree. The proposed range (0.1-10 m/Myr) and the specific weight distribution represent reasonable expert judgment based on the cited evidence, but go beyond what is explicitly stated. The characterization of epistemic uncertainty and paucity of paleoseismic studies is well-supported by KB. The logic is defensible but involves inference rather than direct citation of a prescribed logic tree, making this UNCERTAIN rather than FALSE.]

## Probability of Seismic Movement in Return Periods Less Than 1/10,000 Years

The range of slip-rates suggested in the previous analysis does not strongly support the supposition that this fault could have seismic movements in return periods less than 1/10,000 years for events approaching $M_{\max}=7.2$. The fundamental relationship between slip rate, earthquake magnitude, and recurrence interval is governed by the seismic moment accumulation rate on the fault. For a fault with slip rate of 1 m/Myr (0.001 mm/yr), the seismic moment accumulation rate is extremely low, resulting in very long recurrence intervals for large magnitude events. The Gutenberg-Richter seismicity recurrence equation states that $\log_{10}(n) = a_0 - b \times M$, where above a given maximum magnitude $M_{\max}$, the rate is assumed to be zero [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. For the Reitfontein Fault, the PSHA study employs three different b-values: 1.35 (weighted 0.30), 1.10 (weighted 0.60), and 1.99 (weighted 0.10) [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. The b-value affects the slope of the magnitude-frequency distribution, with higher b-values indicating a greater proportion of smaller earthquakes relative to larger ones. Because of the low probability of very large earthquakes, $M_{\max}$ does not critically affect ground motion recurrence estimates for return periods up to hundreds of years, especially when the b-value is high [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. Disaggregation of the hazard generally shows that the majority of hazard, at least for moderate return periods, comes from lower magnitudes and is not unduly affected by the choice of $M_{\max}$ [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The practical implication is that earthquakes approaching $M_{\max}=7.2$ contribute minimally to hazard at return periods of 10,000 years due to their extreme rarity given the low slip rate [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. For events of magnitude 5.5 to 6.5, which would represent the more probable range given the slip rate and seismogenic characteristics, return periods less than 1/10,000 years are more plausible. The Kango Fault, with a slip rate 200 times higher (200 m/Myr) than the Reitfontein assumption, produced a paleoseismic event of magnitude $M_w$ 6.97-7.18 in the early Holocene, demonstrating that even highly active South African faults have extremely long recurrence intervals for events approaching magnitude 7 [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. The epistemic uncertainty in slip rates of at least one order of magnitude found in stable continental region studies further complicates the estimation of return periods [WEB:https://mdpi.com/2076-3263/9/10/408/htm].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph's conclusion that the suggested slip-rate range does not strongly support seismic movements approaching Mmax=7.2 in return periods less than 1/10,000 years is well-grounded in the KB evidence. The KB explicitly states that "because of the low probability of very large earthquakes, Mmax does not critically affect ground motion recurrence estimates for return periods up to hundreds of years" and that "earthquakes approaching Mmax contribute minimally to short-return-period ground motions due to their extreme rarity." The Gutenberg-Richter equation and b-value weights (1.35 at 0.30, 1.10 at 0.60, 1.99 at 0.10) are directly cited from KB. The comparison with Kango Fault (200 m/Myr producing early Holocene event of 6.97-7.18) effectively illustrates that even faults 200 times more active have very long recurrence intervals for M~7 events. The fundamental physics relating low slip rate (1 m/Myr = 0.001 mm/yr) to low moment accumulation and long recurrence is sound. The external citation regarding epistemic uncertainty in SCR slip rates supports the discussion. The distinction between events approaching 7.2 versus smaller events (5.5-6.5) being more probable at shorter return periods is consistent with the Gutenberg-Richter framework described in KB.]

## Gutenberg-Richter Parameters and B-Value Logic Tree

The Gutenberg-Richter parameters for a fault of this type would be characterized by a relatively high b-value reflecting the stable continental region setting and the dominance of smaller magnitude events. The Gutenberg-Richter seismicity recurrence equation is $\log_{10}(n) = a_0 - b \times M$, where $b$ is the Richter b-value representing the relative proportion of small to large events, $M$ is earthquake magnitude, and $n$ is the number of earthquakes in magnitude range $M \pm \Delta M$ [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. The parameter $a_0$ represents the number of earthquakes of magnitude zero or greater and defines the overall activity rate [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The PSHA study for the Reitfontein Fault employs three different b-values: 1.35 (weighted 0.30), 1.10 (weighted 0.60), and 1.99 (weighted 0.10) [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. The dominant weight of 0.60 on the intermediate b-value of 1.10 suggests this is considered the most representative value for the Reitfontein Fault based on regional seismicity characteristics [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. Regional context from the EZ-FRISK Africa model shows that the Drakensberg zone has a b-value of 1.04 and the Kaapvaal zone has a b-value of 1.06, indicating a moderate ratio of small to large events [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. Research on b-value variability indicates that values in the approximate range of 0.5 to 2.0 are observed depending on the source environment of the region, with stable continental regions typically exhibiting values near or above 1.0 [WEB:https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/199/3/1765/619003]. A smaller b-value for main shocks increases significantly the probability for large events in seismogenic areas with important consequences for seismic risk evaluation [WEB:https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/199/3/1765/619003]. For a logic tree approach, the following structure is proposed: b-value of 0.90 with weight 0.20 representing a lower b-value scenario that increases the relative probability of larger magnitude events, b-value of 1.10 with weight 0.60 as the central value matching the PSHA assumption and regional seismicity characteristics, and b-value of 1.40 with weight 0.20 representing a higher b-value scenario where activity is dominated by smaller events. This range brackets the regional values from the EZ-FRISK model (1.04-1.06) and captures the epistemic uncertainty in magnitude-frequency distribution for the stable continental region setting. The high b-value branch (1.40) was selected instead of the extreme value of 1.99 used in the original PSHA to maintain a more physically plausible range while still representing the upper uncertainty bound. The practical effect on hazard is that earthquakes approaching $M_{\max}$ contribute minimally to short-return-period ground motions due to their extreme rarity, as evidenced by disaggregation analyses showing that the majority of hazard comes from lower magnitudes [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md].^[Verdict: UNCERTAIN, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: The paragraph correctly cites the Gutenberg-Richter equation and b-value weights from the original PSHA study (1.35 at 0.30, 1.10 at 0.60, 1.99 at 0.10) as documented in the KB. The regional b-values for Drakensberg (1.04) and Kaapvaal (1.06) zones are accurately cited from KB. The external web citation regarding b-value range (0.5-2.0) and the effect of smaller b-values on large event probability is appropriate. However, the proposed alternative logic tree (0.90 at 0.20, 1.10 at 0.60, 1.40 at 0.20) represents a modification of the original PSHA logic tree that is not explicitly recommended in the KB documents. The rationale for selecting 1.40 instead of 1.99 for the upper branch is explained but represents expert judgment rather than a cited recommendation. The fundamental understanding of b-value effects on magnitude distribution is correct and well-supported, but the specific proposed logic tree structure goes beyond what is explicitly stated in the sources. The characterization of hazard being dominated by lower magnitudes is directly supported by KB statements. This makes the verdict UNCERTAIN as the technical content is sound but involves prescription beyond the cited evidence.]
