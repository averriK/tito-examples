# Analysis of Epistemic Uncertainty for the Reitfontein Fault: Maximum Magnitude, Slip Rates, and Recurrence Parameters

## Fault Activity Classification

The Reitfontein Fault does not meet the conventional criteria for neotectonic classification and instead appears to be a paleoseismic structure with minor present-day activity. A neotectonic fault is defined as one that has hosted displacement under conditions imposed by the current crustal stress regime and therefore may move again in the future. The current crustal stress regime in South Africa was established sometime in the last 40 to 11 million years [KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. Active faults are conventionally defined as structures known to have produced historical earthquakes or shown evidence of movement in the last 35,000 years [KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md][WEB:https://www.usgs.gov/publications/neotectonic-and-paleoseismic-analysis-northwest-extent-holocene-surface-deformation]. This 35,000-year timeframe falls within the Late Quaternary period, which is significant for paleoseismic fault classification, and permits the study of the distribution of individual paleoearthquakes over time periods of thousands or tens of thousands of years [WEB:https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264370799000605].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph accurately describes the distinction between neotectonic and paleoseismic faults based on the 35,000-year criterion. The KB source (Mmax.research.compile.2.md) explicitly states that "active faults are conventionally defined as structures known to have produced historical earthquakes or shown evidence of movement in the last 35,000 years" and that "the current crustal stress regime in South Africa was established sometime in the last 40 to 11 million years." The external web source from USGS confirms the neotectonic and paleoseismic classification framework and the significance of the Late Quaternary timeframe. The definition provided for neotectonic faults is consistent with standard seismological literature.]

The Reitfontein Fault is at least 2.0 Ga old and has accommodated both normal and oblique reverse movement in the geological past [KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. There is no known geological or geomorphological evidence to suggest neotectonic activity on this structure [KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The fault has only been associated with minor present-day seismic activity according to Singh et al. (2009) [KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The characterization as a reportedly active fault with an assigned slip rate of 1 m/Myr represents a conservative engineering assumption rather than empirical evidence of neotectonic displacement [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. In stable continental regions like South Africa, faults may exhibit episodic behavior with recurrence intervals of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years between ground-rupturing events, and features of low tectonic loading rate, activity migration in space, and clustering in time separated by ten thousand years of seismic quiescence are observed along faults in SCRs [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][WEB:https://www.academia.edu/67924001/Temporal_clustering_of_surface_ruptures_on_stable_continental_region_faults_a_case_study_from_the_Cadell_fault_scarp_south_eastern_Australia].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph accurately characterizes the Reitfontein Fault based on multiple KB sources. The statement about the fault being "at least 2.0 Ga old" and lacking "geological or geomorphological evidence to suggest neotectonic activity" is directly supported by Mmax.research.compile.2.md. The association with "minor present-day seismic activity according to Singh et al. (2009)" is cited in both KB documents. The description of the 1 m/Myr slip rate as "a conservative engineering assumption rather than empirical evidence" is consistent with both KB sources, which state "no slip rate has been published for this reportedly active fault, and therefore a slip rate of 1 m/Myr is assigned." The temporal clustering characteristics of SCR faults are supported by the external academic source on Australian SCR faults, which describes similar episodic behavior patterns.]

## Evidence of Activity in the Last 35,000 Years

Based on the findings in the knowledge base, there is no empirical evidence to affirm that the Reitfontein Fault had activity in the last 35,000 years. The absence of such evidence is explicitly documented, with no known geological or geomorphological indicators suggesting neotectonic activity on this structure [KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The only documented seismicity associated with the Reitfontein Fault is described as minor present-day seismic activity, which likely represents stress perturbations from regional tectonic or mining-induced sources rather than evidence of large-magnitude rupture capability [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The South Deep PSHA study methodology acknowledges the complexity of mining-induced seismicity by excluding events suspected of being mining-related with magnitudes less than M4.0 in order to minimize the influence of induced seismicity in hazard estimates [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph accurately reports the absence of empirical evidence for Reitfontein Fault activity in the last 35,000 years, directly supported by Mmax.research.compile.2.md, which explicitly states "there is no known geological or geomorphological evidence to suggest neotectonic activity on this structure." The characterization of documented seismicity as "minor present-day seismic activity" is consistent with both KB sources. The statement about mining-induced seismicity exclusion is accurately cited from both KB documents, which describe the M4.0 threshold for excluding mining-related events. The interpretation that minor seismicity "likely represents stress perturbations" rather than large-magnitude rupture capability is a reasonable inference supported by the context in the KB sources.]

Paleoseismic investigations would be required to determine whether the Reitfontein Fault has ruptured within the Late Quaternary period. Such investigations could include trenching across the fault trace to identify evidence of surface-rupturing earthquakes, dating of displaced geological units, or analysis of geomorphological features indicative of cumulative displacement [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. A field investigation would be required to improve understanding of faults near the South Deep Mine site and to reduce uncertainties associated with the activity rates of the active structures included in the study [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. If the common recurrence interval in an area is 20,000 to 50,000 years, maps should include faults that are 50,000 to 100,000 years old, which represents two to five typical earthquake cycles and allows for temporal variability in slip rate and recurrence intervals [WEB:https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264370799000605]. The absence of quantified slip-rate data for the Reitfontein Fault reflects the general paucity of paleoseismic studies on South African faults [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph accurately describes paleoseismic investigation methods needed for the Reitfontein Fault. The statement about required investigations including "trenching across the fault trace," "dating of displaced geological units," and "analysis of geomorphological features" is supported by Mmax.research.compile.1.md and Mmax.research.compile.2.md. The need for "field investigation" to "reduce uncertainties associated with the activity rates" is directly quoted from both KB sources. The 20,000-50,000 year recurrence interval guidance is appropriately cited from the external paleoseismic literature source. The observation about "absence of quantified slip-rate data" and "general paucity of paleoseismic studies on South African faults" accurately reflects statements in both KB documents.]

## Logic Tree Weight for Maximum Magnitude of 7.2

In a logic tree for maximum magnitude, assigning a weight to $M_{max} = 7.2$ requires careful consideration of multiple lines of evidence and significant epistemic uncertainties. The $M_{max} = 7.2$ value assigned to the Reitfontein Fault was determined using the Wells and Coppersmith (1994) relationship for a 64 km fault length with normal mechanism [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md][DOI:10.1785/BSSA0840040974]. Wells and Coppersmith (1994) developed empirical relationships among moment magnitude, surface rupture length, subsurface rupture length, and rupture area based on a global compilation of historical earthquakes, with log-linear regressions showing standard deviations of 0.25 to 0.35 magnitude units [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][DOI:10.1785/BSSA0840040974]. This uncertainty range suggests that the true $M_{max}$ for a 64 km rupture could range from approximately $M_w$ 6.9 to 7.5 [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph accurately describes the basis for $M_{max} = 7.2$ using Wells and Coppersmith (1994). Both KB sources explicitly state that "$M_{max}$ of 7.2 assigned to the Reitfontein Fault has been determined using the relationship published in Wells and Coppersmith (1994)" for "a 64 km fault length and normal mechanism." The DOI citation provides the authoritative reference for the Wells-Coppersmith scaling relationships. The standard deviations of 0.25 to 0.35 magnitude units are accurately cited from Mmax.research.compile.1.md. The calculated uncertainty range of approximately $M_w$ 6.9 to 7.5 is consistent with applying the standard deviation to the central value of 7.2.]

The regional seismological context provides important constraints on the plausibility of $M_{max} = 7.2$. South Africa is located in a stable continental region with the largest recorded earthquake being the Ceres event of September 29, 1969, with magnitude $M_w$ 6.2 [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. Research on stable continental regions has found that Archean and Early Proterozoic cratonic lithosphere with higher than average shear-wave velocity have fewer crustal earthquakes and a lower value of maximum moment magnitude, with no earthquakes exceeding $M_w > 6$ above mantle lithosphere with velocity anomalies greater than 3.5 percent, and for cratonic interiors with seismically determined thick lithosphere, the maximum moment magnitude found in the earthquake catalog is $M_{cmax} = 6.0$ [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The Kaapvaal Craton, where the Reitfontein Fault is located, is an Archean craton formed between 2.7 and 3.7 Ga with lithospheric thickness reaching depths of 300 to 350 km and seismogenic depths ranging from 5 to 16 km [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md][WEB:https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018JB015631]. However, paleoseismic evidence from stable continental regions globally indicates that prehistoric earthquakes may have greatly exceeded maximum observed instrumental magnitudes, with studies identifying normal fault scarps in SCRs interpreted as having failed in large earthquakes with $M_w > 7$ [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph accurately presents regional seismological context for the Kaapvaal Craton. The $M_w$ 6.2 Ceres earthquake as South Africa's largest recorded event is stated in both KB sources. The discussion of cratonic lithosphere characteristics and the $M_{cmax} = 6.0$ threshold for thick cratonic interiors is directly cited from both KB documents and is consistent with published seismological research on SCRs. The Kaapvaal Craton age of 2.7-3.7 Ga is accurately cited from the KB sources. The lithospheric thickness of 300-350 km and seismogenic depth range of 5-16 km are supported by the external web source from AGU (Kgaswane 2018) and the KB sources. The statement about paleoseismic evidence for $M_w > 7$ events in SCRs is accurately cited from both KB documents.]

Within the South Africa PSHA study area, the EZ-FRISK Africa model assigns $M_{max}$ values of 7.23 to the Drakensberg zone and 7.0 to the Kaapvaal zone, while the GEM ZAF model uses values ranging from 5.28 to 6.54 for various zones, with the ZEBED zone that includes the study area having $M_{max}$ values of 5.28, 5.53, and 5.93 with weights of 0.45, 0.35, and 0.20 respectively [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The substantial variability in these regional $M_{max}$ estimates reflects epistemic uncertainty in stable continental region seismogenic potential [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. For comparison, the Pretorius Fault with a 10 km length is assigned $M_{max} = 5.7$, demonstrating the strong sensitivity of maximum magnitude estimates to fault dimensions via the Wells-Coppersmith relationships [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph accurately reports regional $M_{max}$ values from the South Deep PSHA study. The EZ-FRISK Africa model values of 7.23 for Drakensberg and 7.0 for Kaapvaal are explicitly stated in both KB sources. The GEM ZAF model values for the ZEBED zone (5.28, 5.53, 5.93 with weights 0.45, 0.35, 0.20) are accurately cited from both KB documents. The characterization of this variability as reflecting "epistemic uncertainty in stable continental region seismogenic potential" is consistent with the discussion in the KB sources. The comparison with Pretorius Fault ($M_{max} = 5.7$ for 10 km length) is accurately cited from both KB sources and appropriately illustrates scaling sensitivity.]

Based on this analysis, a recommended logic tree for $M_{max}$ should include at least three branches reflecting the epistemic uncertainty. A conservative approach would assign: $M_{max} = 6.5$ with weight 0.25 representing a scenario where scaling relationships overestimate SCR seismogenic potential and the instrumental/cratonic constraints dominate; $M_{max} = 7.2$ with weight 0.50 representing the Wells-Coppersmith central estimate for the full 64 km mapped length; and $M_{max} = 7.5$ with weight 0.25 representing a scenario where the full seismogenic length ruptures with paleoseismic analogs from other SCRs and accounting for scaling relationship uncertainty. This weighting scheme places the highest weight on the engineering estimate while acknowledging substantial uncertainty in both directions. The 0.50 weight on $M_{max} = 7.2$ reflects that this value is derived from well-established empirical scaling relationships but must be tempered by the lack of neotectonic evidence and the cratonic setting. An alternative, more conservative weighting would shift probability toward lower magnitudes: $M_{max} = 6.5$ with weight 0.40, $M_{max} = 7.2$ with weight 0.35, and $M_{max} = 7.5$ with weight 0.25, reflecting greater emphasis on the cratonic constraints and instrumental record.^[Verdict: UNCERTAIN, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: The paragraph proposes specific logic tree weights for $M_{max}$ values, but these weights are not directly provided in the KB sources; rather, they represent a synthesis and expert judgment based on the evidence discussed in previous paragraphs. The KB sources describe the epistemic uncertainties and various lines of evidence (Wells-Coppersmith scaling, cratonic constraints, regional PSHA models) but do not explicitly recommend specific weights for an $M_{max}$ logic tree. The proposed weighting schemes (0.25/0.50/0.25 and 0.40/0.35/0.25) represent reasonable engineering judgments given the evidence presented, but lack direct empirical validation from the cited sources. The rationale provided for each branch (scaling relationships, instrumental constraints, paleoseismic analogs, uncertainty ranges) is logically consistent with the evidence in the KB sources, though the specific numerical weights are inferred rather than cited.]

## Compatible Slip-Rates and Logic Tree

Based on the findings in the knowledge base and the regional seismotectonic setting, the compatible slip-rate range for the Reitfontein Fault in a stable continental region context would be 0.001 to 1.0 mm/yr. No empirical slip-rate evidence exists for the Reitfontein Fault; the 1 m/Myr (equivalent to 0.001 mm/yr) value is an engineering assumption assigned in the absence of published data [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The PSHA study explicitly states that no slip rate has been published for this reportedly active fault, and therefore a slip rate of 1 m/Myr is assigned [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. This represents the minimum conservative value typically used for faults that show evidence of activity but lack quantified slip-rate measurements [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph accurately characterizes the slip-rate situation for the Reitfontein Fault. The statement that "no empirical slip-rate evidence exists" and that "1 m/Myr value is an engineering assumption assigned in the absence of published data" is directly supported by both KB sources, which explicitly state "no slip rate has been published for this reportedly active fault, and therefore a slip rate of 1 m/Myr is assigned." The conversion of 1 m/Myr to 0.001 mm/yr is mathematically correct (1 meter per million years = 0.001 millimeters per year). The characterization as "minimum conservative value" is consistent with the discussion in both KB documents. The proposed range of 0.001 to 1.0 mm/yr aligns with typical SCR slip rates discussed in the context.]

Regional slip-rate context provides important benchmarks for comparison. The Kango Fault in the southern Cape Fold Belt represents a benchmark for active South African faults, with measured slip rates on the order of 200 m/Myr, which is 200 times higher than Reitfontein's assigned rate [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. The Pretorius Fault, which is classified as active and has demonstrated recent reactivation during mine seismicity, is also assigned a slip rate of 1 m/Myr in the absence of published estimates [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. For bedrock faults that do not show evidence of movement in the last 10 million years but are included due to favorable orientation in the current stress regime, a low uplift rate of 1 m/Myr is assigned [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. Research on stable continental regions indicates that average slip rates in SCRs can be as low as 0.14 mm/yr, with some studies showing even lower rates, and low slip rates of 0.05 to 2 mm/yr mean that the frequency of large magnitude earthquake events will be low with recurrence intervals of approximately $10^3$ to $10^4$ years [WEB:https://www.academia.edu/67924001/Temporal_clustering_of_surface_ruptures_on_stable_continental_region_faults_a_case_study_from_the_Cadell_fault_scarp_south_eastern_Australia][WEB:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97167-w]. Evidence from Mongolia shows at least 3 surface rupturing earthquakes during the last 50,000 years associated with a slip-rate of 0.06 plus or minus 0.01 mm/yr, representing very slow deformation rates typical of stable continental regions [WEB:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97167-w].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph accurately presents regional slip-rate context with proper citations. The Kango Fault slip rate of 200 m/Myr and the statement that it is "200 times higher than Reitfontein's assigned rate" is accurately cited from Mmax.research.compile.1.md. The Pretorius Fault assignment of 1 m/Myr is correctly cited from both KB sources. The statement about bedrock faults receiving 1 m/Myr for favorable orientation in current stress regime is accurately cited from Mmax.research.compile.1.md. The external web sources provide appropriate supporting evidence for SCR slip rate ranges: the 0.14 mm/yr average and 0.05-2 mm/yr range with $10^3$-$10^4$ year recurrence intervals from the Australian SCR study, and the 0.06±0.01 mm/yr Mongolian example from the Nature article. All numerical values and relationships are accurately reported.]

A logic tree for slip-rates should reflect the epistemic uncertainty associated with the lack of empirical measurements and the range of plausible values for stable continental region faults. The following three-branch logic tree is recommended: 0.001 mm/yr (1 m/Myr) with weight 0.30, representing the minimum conservative assumption currently used in the PSHA and appropriate for faults with no demonstrable Quaternary activity; 0.05 mm/yr (50 m/Myr) with weight 0.50, representing a central estimate based on typical SCR fault slip rates observed in paleoseismic studies from analogous cratonic settings; and 0.2 mm/yr (200 m/Myr) with weight 0.20, representing an upper bound scenario consistent with the more active structures in South Africa such as the Kango Fault. This weighting scheme places the highest probability on slip rates within the documented range for stable continental region faults globally while maintaining a conservative lower bound. An alternative, more conservative approach would shift more weight to lower slip rates: 0.001 mm/yr with weight 0.50, 0.05 mm/yr with weight 0.35, and 0.2 mm/yr with weight 0.15, reflecting greater emphasis on the absence of empirical evidence for significant Quaternary activity on the Reitfontein Fault.^[Verdict: UNCERTAIN, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: The paragraph proposes specific logic tree weights for slip rates, but these weights are not provided in the KB sources and represent expert judgment rather than empirical data. The KB sources describe various slip rate values (1 m/Myr for Reitfontein and Pretorius, 200 m/Myr for Kango) and external sources provide SCR slip rate ranges (0.05-2 mm/yr), but none of these sources explicitly recommend specific logic tree weights. The three slip rate branches (0.001, 0.05, 0.2 mm/yr) are reasonable based on the evidence presented: 0.001 mm/yr is the current PSHA assumption cited in KB sources, 0.05 mm/yr falls within the SCR range from external sources, and 0.2 mm/yr matches the Kango Fault rate from KB sources. However, the specific weights (0.30/0.50/0.20 and 0.50/0.35/0.15) are inferred judgments without direct empirical support. The rationale for each branch and the weighting philosophy are logically consistent with the evidence but represent interpretation rather than directly cited facts.]

## Probability of Seismic Movement in Return Periods Less Than 10,000 Years

The range of slip-rates discussed above does permit the possibility that the Reitfontein Fault could have seismic movements in return periods less than 10,000 years, though the probability varies substantially depending on which slip-rate scenario is considered. The relationship between slip rate, earthquake magnitude, recurrence interval, and return period can be evaluated using the seismic moment accumulation and release model. For a fault with length $L = 64$ km, width $W$ dependent on seismogenic depth and dip angle, and slip per event $D$ related to magnitude through scaling relationships, the recurrence interval $T_r$ is approximately equal to $D / \dot{s}$, where $\dot{s}$ is the slip rate [WEB:https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3710655/].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph accurately introduces the relationship between slip rates and return periods less than 10,000 years. The statement that "the range of slip-rates discussed above does permit the possibility" is a reasonable inference from the slip rates presented in the previous section (0.001-0.2 mm/yr). The basic physics relating slip rate, earthquake magnitude, recurrence interval, and return period through seismic moment accumulation is correctly described. The recurrence interval formula $T_r \approx D / \dot{s}$ (where $D$ is slip per event and $\dot{s}$ is slip rate) is accurately cited from the external PMC source on recurrence interval estimation. The statement about fault dimensions (64 km length, width dependent on seismogenic depth and dip) correctly references the Reitfontein Fault geometry discussed in KB sources.]

For the lowest slip-rate scenario of 0.001 mm/yr, a $M_w$ 7.2 earthquake with approximately 2 to 3 meters of slip per event would yield a recurrence interval of 2,000 to 3,000 years [WEB:https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3710655/]. For the central slip-rate estimate of 0.05 mm/yr, the same magnitude event would have a recurrence interval of 40 to 60 years. For the upper slip-rate scenario of 0.2 mm/yr, the recurrence interval would be 10 to 15 years. These calculations assume characteristic earthquake behavior where the fault repeatedly ruptures in events of similar magnitude. However, stable continental region faults typically do not exhibit characteristic earthquake behavior but instead follow Gutenberg-Richter magnitude-frequency distributions with substantial variability in event size [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md].^[Verdict: UNCERTAIN, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: The paragraph presents calculated recurrence intervals for different slip-rate scenarios, but these specific numerical calculations (2,000-3,000 years for 0.001 mm/yr, 40-60 years for 0.05 mm/yr, 10-15 years for 0.2 mm/yr) are not provided in the cited sources. The calculations apply the recurrence formula $T_r = D / \dot{s}$ using assumed slip per event of 2-3 meters for $M_w$ 7.2, which is reasonable based on Wells-Coppersmith scaling relationships, but this specific slip value is not explicitly stated in the KB sources. The PMC source provides the formula framework but not these specific calculations. The assumption of 2-3 m slip for $M_w$ 7.2 is within plausible ranges for Wells-Coppersmith relationships, but should be verified. The statement about SCR faults following Gutenberg-Richter distributions rather than characteristic earthquake behavior is consistent with seismological understanding and supported by the KB sources' discussion of G-R parameters, though not explicitly stated in those exact terms.]

The Gutenberg-Richter parameters assigned to the Reitfontein Fault in the PSHA study provide an alternative framework for estimating probabilities. The fault source modeling employs three different b-values: 1.35 with weight 0.30, 1.10 with weight 0.60, and 1.99 with weight 0.10 [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The parameter $a_0$ represents the number of earthquakes of magnitude zero or greater and defines the overall activity rate [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. Because of the low probability of very large earthquakes, $M_{max}$ does not critically affect ground motion recurrence estimates for return periods up to hundreds of years, especially when the b-value is high, as higher b-values indicate a greater proportion of smaller earthquakes [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. Disaggregation of the hazard generally shows that the majority of hazard, at least for moderate return periods, comes from lower magnitudes and is not unduly affected by the choice of $M_{max}$ [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph accurately presents the Gutenberg-Richter parameters from the South Deep PSHA study. The three b-values (1.35, 1.10, 1.99) and their weights (0.30, 0.60, 0.10) are explicitly stated in both KB sources (Mmax.research.compile.1.md and Mmax.research.compile.2.md). The definition of parameter $a_0$ as representing "the number of earthquakes of magnitude zero or greater" and defining "the overall activity rate" is accurately cited from both KB sources. The statement about $M_{max}$ not critically affecting ground motion recurrence for return periods up to hundreds of years when b-value is high is directly quoted from both KB sources. The explanation that "higher b-values indicate a greater proportion of smaller earthquakes" accurately interprets the Gutenberg-Richter relationship. The statement about disaggregation showing majority of hazard from lower magnitudes is accurately cited from both KB sources.]

A return period of 10,000 years corresponds to an annual exceedance probability of 0.0001 or 0.01 percent [WEB:https://docs.openquake.org/oq-engine/3.21/manual/underlying-science/calculations.html]. For a 10,000-year return period, the probability of at least one event occurring in any given year is extremely low, and the probability of occurrence within a 50-year exposure period is approximately 0.5 percent. Research on stable continental regions indicates that low slip rates of 0.05 to 2 mm/yr mean that the frequency of large magnitude earthquake events will be low with recurrence intervals of approximately $10^3$ to $10^4$ years [WEB:https://www.academia.edu/67924001/Temporal_clustering_of_surface_ruptures_on_stable_continental_region_faults_a_case_study_from_the_Cadell_fault_scarp_south_eastern_Australia]. Features of low tectonic loading rate, activity migration in space, and clustering in time separated by ten thousand years of seismic quiescence are observed along faults in SCRs [WEB:https://www.academia.edu/67924001/Temporal_clustering_of_surface_ruptures_on_stable_continental_region_faults_a_case_study_from_the_Cadell_fault_scarp_south_eastern_Australia]. Based on this evidence, the Reitfontein Fault could plausibly generate seismic movements within return periods of less than 10,000 years, particularly for the central and upper slip-rate scenarios, though events approaching $M_{max} = 7.2$ would be extremely rare and contribute minimally to short-return-period ground motions.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph accurately characterizes return period probabilities and SCR earthquake recurrence patterns. The conversion of 10,000-year return period to annual exceedance probability of 0.0001 (0.01%) is mathematically correct and appropriately cited from the OpenQuake Engine documentation. The calculation of approximately 0.5% probability in 50 years follows standard probability formulas for return periods. The statement about low slip rates (0.05-2 mm/yr) corresponding to recurrence intervals of $10^3$-$10^4$ years is accurately cited from the Australian SCR study. The description of SCR fault characteristics (low tectonic loading rate, temporal clustering, seismic quiescence periods) is accurately cited from the same external source. The conclusion that Reitfontein Fault "could plausibly generate seismic movements within return periods of less than 10,000 years" is a reasonable synthesis of the evidence presented, properly qualified as "particularly for the central and upper slip-rate scenarios" and noting that $M_{max}$ 7.2 events would be "extremely rare."]

## Gutenberg-Richter Parameters and B-Value Logic Tree

The Gutenberg-Richter seismicity recurrence equation states that $\log_{10}(n) = a_0 - b \times M$, where $b$ is the Richter b-value representing the relative proportion of small to large events, $M$ is earthquake magnitude, and $n$ is the number of earthquakes in magnitude range $M \pm \Delta M$ [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. Above a given maximum magnitude $M_{max}$, the rate is assumed to be zero [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The b-value fundamentally controls the relative probability of different magnitude earthquakes but does not directly determine $M_{max}$ itself [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. A lower b-value means that the ratio of large to small earthquakes is higher, which increases the probability of larger magnitude events approaching $M_{max}$ occurring within a given time period [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph accurately presents the Gutenberg-Richter equation and b-value interpretation. The equation $\log_{10}(n) = a_0 - b \times M$ is explicitly stated in both KB sources. The definition of parameter $b$ as "representing the relative proportion of small to large events" is consistent with both KB sources. The statement that "above a given maximum magnitude $M_{max}$, the rate is assumed to be zero" is directly quoted from both KB sources. The explanation that "b-value fundamentally controls the relative probability" but "does not directly determine $M_{max}$ itself" accurately reflects the discussion in Mmax.research.compile.1.md. The interpretation that "lower b-value means that the ratio of large to small earthquakes is higher" is the correct physical interpretation of the Gutenberg-Richter relationship.]

For the Reitfontein Fault, the PSHA study assigns three b-values in a logic tree framework: 1.35 with weight 0.30, 1.10 with weight 0.60, and 1.99 with weight 0.10 [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md]. The dominant weight of 0.60 on the intermediate b-value of 1.10 suggests this is considered the most representative value for the Reitfontein Fault based on regional seismicity characteristics [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. The high b-value of 1.99 with low weight of 0.10 represents a scenario where earthquake activity is dominated by smaller events, making approach to $M_{max} = 7.2$ highly improbable [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. Conversely, the lower b-value of 1.35 with weight 0.30 increases the relative probability of larger magnitude events [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md]. Regional context from the EZ-FRISK Africa model shows b-values of 1.04 for the Drakensberg zone and 1.06 for the Kaapvaal zone [KB:Mmax.research.compile.1.md][KB:Mmax.research.compile.2.md], which bracket the lower end of the Reitfontein Fault's assigned b-value range.^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph accurately reports the b-values and logic tree weights assigned to the Reitfontein Fault. The three b-values (1.35, 1.10, 1.99) and their weights (0.30, 0.60, 0.10) are explicitly stated in both KB sources. The interpretation that the 0.60 weight on b=1.10 suggests it is "most representative" is a reasonable inference from the logic tree structure. The characterization of the high b-value (1.99) scenario as making "$M_{max} = 7.2$ highly improbable" is consistent with the discussion in Mmax.research.compile.1.md about high b-values indicating greater proportion of smaller earthquakes. The statement about lower b-value (1.35) increasing "relative probability of larger magnitude events" correctly interprets G-R physics. The regional b-values of 1.04 (Drakensberg) and 1.06 (Kaapvaal) from EZ-FRISK are accurately cited from both KB sources, and the observation that these "bracket the lower end" of Reitfontein's range is mathematically correct.]

Research on stable continental regions indicates that typical b-values are around 0.85 to 1.0, which is somewhat lower than the global long-term average of approximately 1.02 for seismically active regions [WEB:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344380553_Good_practices_in_PSHA_declustering_b-value_estimation_foreshocks_and_aftershocks_inclusion_a_case_study_in_Italy]. However, b-values can vary widely across different regions and tectonic settings, ranging from 0.3 to 2.5 [WEB:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344380553_Good_practices_in_PSHA_declustering_b-value_estimation_foreshocks_and_aftershocks_inclusion_a_case_study_in_Italy]. For PSHA applications in stable continental regions, logic trees for b-values typically include three branches representing low, central, and high estimates to capture epistemic uncertainty [WEB:https://docs.openquake.org/oq-engine/3.21/manual/underlying-science/logic-trees.html].^[Verdict: TRUE, Confidence: HIGH, Rationale: The paragraph accurately presents b-value ranges for SCR and PSHA applications. The statement about typical SCR b-values around 0.85-1.0 is supported by the external web search results, which indicated that "typical b-values in stable continental regions are around 0.85~1.0." The global long-term average of approximately 1.02 is accurately cited from the ResearchGate source on PSHA good practices. The wide range of 0.3 to 2.5 for b-values across different regions is accurately cited from the same external source. The statement about logic trees typically including three branches (low, central, high) for epistemic uncertainty is appropriately cited from the OpenQuake Engine documentation and is consistent with standard PSHA practice.]

For a fault of this type in a stable continental region setting, the recommended b-value range should reflect both the regional seismicity characteristics and the epistemic uncertainty inherent in sparse seismicity data. A revised logic tree for the Reitfontein Fault b-value could include: 0.85 with weight 0.20, representing a lower b-value scenario consistent with typical SCR values and increasing the relative probability of larger events; 1.05 with weight 0.60, representing a central estimate based on the regional EZ-FRISK b-values for the Kaapvaal and Drakensberg zones; and 1.30 with weight 0.20, representing an upper b-value scenario where smaller events dominate. This revised scheme maintains a three-branch structure but shifts the central value slightly lower to better align with documented SCR b-values. The current PSHA b-values of 1.10 to 1.35 appear reasonable for the central and upper branches, though the inclusion of the very high b-value of 1.99 may overweight scenarios where $M_{max}$ 7.2 is essentially unreachable. An alternative approach would maintain the current central b-value of 1.10 with weight 0.60 while revising the lower and upper branches to 0.90 with weight 0.25 and 1.35 with weight 0.15, providing a more balanced representation of SCR seismicity characteristics.^[Verdict: UNCERTAIN, Confidence: MEDIUM, Rationale: The paragraph proposes revised b-value logic trees, but these specific recommendations are not provided in the KB sources and represent expert judgment rather than empirical data. The KB sources document the current PSHA b-values (1.35, 1.10, 1.99 with weights 0.30, 0.60, 0.10) and regional b-values from EZ-FRISK (1.04, 1.06), but do not propose revised logic tree weights. The external sources establish that typical SCR b-values are around 0.85-1.0, which provides support for proposing lower values than the current PSHA scheme. The proposed values (0.85, 1.05, 1.30 with weights 0.20, 0.60, 0.20) are reasonable given the evidence about SCR characteristics, and the criticism of the b=1.99 branch as potentially "overweighting scenarios where $M_{max}$ 7.2 is essentially unreachable" is a logical interpretation. However, the specific weights are inferred judgments without direct empirical validation. The alternative approach (0.90, 1.10, 1.35 with weights 0.25, 0.60, 0.15) similarly represents expert interpretation rather than directly cited recommendations.]
